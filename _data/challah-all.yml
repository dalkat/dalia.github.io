  heading: Challah Baking Resources
  subheading: I teach challah baking classes a few times each month, where I teach about the ancient Jewish tradition of making a braided bread known as ‘Challah’. This tradition has been passed down in my culture from generation to generation and when I left my job in consulting, I became eager to teach others about the ritual and craft of making and braiding challah, as well as share the rich traditions that make up my mixed Ashkenazi and Mizrahi Jewish heritage!
