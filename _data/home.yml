      heading: Diversity & <br>Inclusion
      text: The workplace is one of the most powerful opportunities to build empathy and understanding amongst different groups. As such, an inclusive workplace has both business and societal benefits. I have studied and designed diversity programs that bridge gaps, with specific focus on (1) how employers can create environments for refugees and minorities to better integrate and thrive in the workplace and (2) bridging divides in the Middle East through Jewish-Arab integration at work.
