Dalia led the innovation workstream for a global toymaker, working with over 10 brands. Leveraging human-centered design, Dalia gathered consumer insights on purchasing behaviors and designed and facilitated ideation workshops with each brand to identify unique strategic and tactical design initiatives that would help improve bottom line while also strengthening trust with the customer. Initiatives were also assessed by impact and speed-to-market.
