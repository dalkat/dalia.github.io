            <b>Instructions</b><Br>
            <ol>
            <i>Make the dough</i><br>
              <li>Combine yeast, sugar, and lukewarm water in large mixing bowl. Mix and allow to stand for 5-10 minutes (yeast should foam). </li> 
              <li>Beat the whole egg in a small cup, then add it to the yeast mixture with oil and salt, and mix well with wooden spoon.</li> 
              <li>Gradually add in flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition (you can knead out any clumps later!). As the mixture thickens and it becomes difficult to mix with the spoon, begin kneading the dough with your hands as you continue to add flour (you may use 3.5 to 4.5 cups of flour total, every batch is different, but the dough shouldn't feel overly dense). Knead dough for 5-10 minutes until dough is smooth and soft, continuing to add flour as needed 2 tablespoons at a time, until the dough is no longer sticky to the touch. </li>
              <li>Optional: If adding chocolate chips or raisins, work into dough as you add the flour in the previous step.  
              <li>Shape the dough into a ball and place in the mixing bowl. Cover bowl with slightly damp kitchen towel and let the dough rise for an hour, punch it down to remove air, then let it rise again for another hour. Do not knead.</li>
              <br><i>Braid and bake!</i>
              <li>Once the dough has risen, split the dough into four equal parts for a four-braid challah (you can also do a three or six braid). Roll into logs on a lightly floured surface or cutting board, and braid.</li>
              <li>Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking tray with parchment paper and lightly flour or oil the surface. Set the braided challah dough on the tray and set it aside in a warm place for about 30 minutes to continue rising (option to cover with towel). </li>
              <li>Brush the challah with egg wash (egg yolk + a teaspoon of water to loosen up the yolk). Optionally sprinkle with sesame/poppy seeds or sprinkles! Bake for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown. Note that the challah will expand as it bakes, so make sure it has at least 3 inches of space on either side to grow.</li>
              <li>Enjoy!</li></ol>
