           <p class="p1"><strong>Trail Mix Method</strong></p>
            <p class="p3">I&rsquo;m really excited to teach you about my trail mix method.</p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p4"><strong>HOW THIS METHOD HELPS AND WHO SHOULD USE IT</strong></p>
            <p class="p3">When I was in Patagonia, I fell in love with my trail mix. Enduring the weight of a loaded 40L backpack, 40mph winds that caused my partner to pull me to the ground, and fickle weather that alternated between rain, sun, snow, and hail in matters of minutes, my trail mix gave me energy during my hikes in Patagonia far greater than those of artificial energy bars or gu&rsquo;s. The trail mix was the perfect balance of everything in (just the right amount of sweet to savory, of raisins to M&amp;Ms, of fruit to nut), and I got exactly what I needed each time. It was the perfect balance of controlling what was in the bag and blindly trusting that whatever I scooped up each time would be delicious.</p>
            <p class="p3">Now, think about what a trail mix bag may look like, but for the things you want to do with your free time each week.</p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3">If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;ve tried a few different ways to approach your unstructured or open time. You may have gone all in on a project for three very intense days, only to come out burnt out. (After all, we are multifaceted individuals and get energy from multiple sources!) You may have tried using asana or to-doist to manage your tasks. You may have tried creating day-by-day goals that you can accomplish every day. You may have blocked a recurring time on your calendar to force yourself to work on a certain goal. You may also have tried going with the flow - just being present and deciding what to do in the moment. If you&rsquo;re like me, these all fell short of working: they either felt too structured and took away all of your excitement and energy, or too unstructured such that you defaulted to what felt easy or what you know; they either made you feel exhausted and burn out, or made you feel guilty for not accomplishing your goals.</p>
            <p class="p3">I&rsquo;ve started using a metaphoric trail mix bag to manage my energy and unstructured time, and this productivity method has completely changed my life. I repeat: this method has completely changed my life. It&rsquo;s changed how I understand and honor my own energy and has helped me come through on daunting tasks that I&rsquo;ve put aside for months. It&rsquo;s simple, but it works, and almost a month into this little experiment I&rsquo;ve accomplished goals I&rsquo;ve put aside for months - like reading the book my high school teacher wrote, writing my application for a program I&rsquo;m excited about, meditating, or putting together my website. For me, Trail mix represents balance between structure and flow, control and surrender. It is organized chaos! It is trusting the universe but doing your part too. It represents my balance of living between Type A and Type B: a ritual of structuring the container, then release and surrender, trusting whatever happens.</p>
            <p class="p3"><strong>It&rsquo;s great for people who:</strong></p>
            <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li3">have a lot of unstructured time that you don&rsquo;t know how to structure (e.g., a sabbatical, part-time work, real-estate investor, etc.)</li>
            <li class="li3">are struggling between flow and structure</li>
            <li class="li3">sit somewhere between Type A and Type B (or aspire to be there)</li>
            <li class="li3">have no problem finding new projects, interests, or goals, but have problems coming through on them</li>
            <li class="li3">tend to default into the most accessible or top-of-mind way to spend their time, and then go all in and burn out</li>
            <li class="li3">Find big tasks daunting and end up procrastinating or giving up</li>
            <li class="li3">feel stuck, moving the same goals or to-do&rsquo;s on next week&rsquo;s list, every week</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p5">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3"><strong>It will help you:</strong></p>
            <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li3">remove decision paralysis in the context of abundant time and opportunity</li>
            <li class="li3">regain autonomy over your time</li>
            <li class="li3">give you the structure to help you serve moments of flow, and better honor those moments of flow</li>
            <li class="li3">better manage your energy and avoid burnout</li>
            <li class="li3">avoid adding random things to your plate that aren&rsquo;t priorities for you (those can be done next week!)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p5">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3"><strong>What do I mean by unstructured time?</strong></p>
            <p class="p3">It&rsquo;s time where you have no external commitments - only commitments to yourself. This can be unemployed time, sabbatical time, or weekend time, but it&rsquo;s that playbox of time where you get to work on you and your goals or aspirations on your own clock. This kind of unstructured time does not need to be productive - and you shouldn&rsquo;t feel bad about doing &lsquo;nothing&rsquo; or not doing &lsquo;enough&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s all society&rsquo;s artificial construct of how we need to be spending our days. We need moments of nothing or boredom to reset and reflect.</p>
            <p class="p3">&mdash;&mdash;</p>
            <p class="p4"><strong>OKAY BUT WHAT IS IT</strong></p>
            <p class="p5">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3"><strong>So what is the trail mix method? </strong>It&rsquo;s a method to structuring your unstructured time in a way that better understands and manages your energy. Like a trail mix bag, it&rsquo;s a mixed pool of different activities, ideas, and goals (i.e., it&rsquo;s not a bag of M&amp;Ms or peanuts, but a mix!), each in little bite-size amounts (e.g., 30 minutes of a task rather than the entirety of the task), that is balanced in it&rsquo;s components (i.e., not too much of any one broader type of activity, like learning or creating). Also like a trail mix bag, you put it together once, and then accept whatever comes out of it. That &lsquo;bite-size&rsquo; activity will be the burst of energy you need to do the task; if you get into &lsquo;flow state&rsquo; or a hyper productive mode and want to do more, you can; and if not, you&rsquo;ve come through on a small commitment, congratulate yourself and you move on to the next one. So, once a week, you set aside 1 hour to build your trail mix bag (upfront structure) by filling it with goals, projects, personas, etc. that you want to work on or manifest in your unstructured time that week; then in your free moments, you reach into your &lsquo;bag&rsquo; and pick out the task you&rsquo;re going to do in that moment. Emphasis on unstructured time: this isn&rsquo;t a tool to manage deadlines or urgent tasks &mdash; that stuff belongs on your calendar or in your To-do app; this is about things you want to do for yourself that can happen today, tomorrow, or end of the week.</p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3"><strong>Why it works:</strong></p>
            <p class="p3">Frankly, I think it works because</p>
            <p class="p3">1) it removes the intimidation factor of a big project or a dreaded (but good for you) activity like working out by making them small time chunks</p>
            <p class="p3">2) it&rsquo;s balanced with different types of activities - for example, not all of them are physical health related or learning related, and it&rsquo;s not about being hyper-productive in one area, which can lead to burn out</p>
            <p class="p3">3) in those &lsquo;AHHH i don&rsquo;t know what to do right now&rsquo; moments, you literally have a crutch to lean on</p>
            <p class="p3">4) it removes the guilt factor that comes with not meeting a deadline you set for yourself</p>
            <p class="p5">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3"><strong>characteristics:</strong></p>
            <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li3">mixed bag - little bit of everything. you don&rsquo;t get a bag full of just one thing (e.g., you aren&rsquo;t making a bag of only M&amp;Ms, or only raisins - gross!)</li>
            <li class="li3">bite size - not project based, but energy based. bursts of energy!</li>
            <li class="li3">balance bag - not too much of anything. think about how the tasks relate to one another, as well as to your energy</li>
            <li class="li3">trust the bag you&rsquo;ve built (or the roots you've laid out) - having blind faith that whatever you need will show up. trust yourself and then surrender to yourself. Remember that <span class="s2">you</span> made the bag, and <span class="s2">you</span> were thinking about what you wanted to do - when you made it, you were coming from a place of empowerment, clarity, inspiration - so trust that past version of yourself!</li>
            <li class="li3">activities can last longer but YOU decide if they do - if you see yourself in flow, you can choose to take that extra m&amp;m or to extend your current task! (but also knowing that you should pull yourself out from going too deep to avoid burnout or imbalance, setting some maximum parameters). Flow is beautiful and hyperproductive, but it is not fleeting! You can get back into it at a later time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p5">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3"><strong>what it&rsquo;s not:</strong></p>
            <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li3">it&rsquo;s not a place to sort your to-do&rsquo;s or the things you &lsquo;have to get done&rsquo; (e.g., project deadline, doctor&rsquo;s appointment, picnic with friends) - because that&rsquo;s not part of your unstructured or free time. this is a way to think about activities you would do in free / unstructured time, after you&rsquo;ve completed your responsibilities for the day. It&rsquo;s things you WANT to do, not have to do; the things you believe will help you grow, increase your happiness, or break down your non-urgent &lsquo;have to&rsquo;s in a way that serves your energy. It&rsquo;s an energy and aspirations management system - that also happens to be a great method for productivity for your free time.</li>
            <li class="li3">It&rsquo;s not for urgent tasks or things that are near-term time bound - you wouldn&rsquo;t want to use it for things that are urgently due tomorrow, but rather things that may be &lsquo;due&rsquo; or done some time that week. The reason for this is that urgent tasks add a priority system and hierarchy, and that undoes the &lsquo;equal value&rsquo; of every handful of trail mix. Normally, I go through my &lsquo;urgent tasks&rsquo; on my Todoist app, and then once my time has been freed, I can switch to my trail mix bag.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="p3">____</p>
            <p class="p4"><strong>HOW TO MAKE YOUR TRAIL MIX BAG</strong></p>
            <p class="p5">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3"><strong>Guiding principles:</strong></p>
            <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li3"><strong>The ritual: </strong></li>
            <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li3">I schedule an hour chunk every Sunday night that I call &lsquo;Trail Mix Sunday&rsquo; where I create my bag for the week. Doesn&rsquo;t matter when you do this (morning, night, Sunday, Wednesday) but ideally whenever you feel your week starts so you can plan for the week.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="li3"><strong>What the &lsquo;bag&rsquo; might look like: </strong></li>
            <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li3">This may be a literal bag - zip lock or otherwise - with pieces of fortune-cookie-sized paper in it. Now THAT&rsquo;s true surrender! It could be a half of a sheet of paper with bullets for the activities. I don&rsquo;t recommend it being a list on your computer because that&rsquo;s too easy to manipulate after you&rsquo;ve set it.</li>
            <li class="li3">I personally keep mine in a moleskin notebook (this one <a href="https://amzn.to/2sP2UMY"><span class="s3">https://amzn.to/2sP2UMY</span></a>). A list isn&rsquo;t as whimsical as a bag, but it helps me adjust which activity I &lsquo;pick out&rsquo; based on where my energetic state is (creative activities versus cerebral, physical, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="li3"><strong>What&rsquo;s in the &lsquo;bag&rsquo;: </strong></li>
            <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li3">Trail mix bag is composed of bite-sized pieces of ideas that you want to pursue, inner personas you want to feel into, activities you want to explore, and anything else that you desire. Throughout the week when you have a free moment, you'll pull out something from the trail mix bag to use that time for.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="li3"><strong>How to make them bite-sized: </strong></li>
            <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li3">As mentioned above, it&rsquo;s not project based (e.g., finish reading X, or write 1 blog post) but energy based. Trail mix would give me about 15-30 minute bursts of energy, and I found that that was actually a great baseline to break down activities. It also helped make tasks more achievable, and by all means if I got into flow I could do it for longer! But that was MY choice to make, after I finished the 5, 15, or 45 minute task. For example: 10 minutes - Read Julie&rsquo;s book. 60 minutes - code personal website. 30 minutes - yoga.</li>
            <li class="li3">The goal is to have a bag where everything has equal priority or desirability - if some things are more desirable than others, you&rsquo;ll end up wanting to do only those things. So, to give all the activities equal weighting/value in the trail mix bag, I balance the enjoyment of an activity and the time it&rsquo;s allocated. For the things that I enjoyed less or that we&rsquo;re more daunting, I would lower the time allocated to it, so it became an easier investment (e.g., I hate reading, so 10 minutes felt like a safe commitment to reading Julie&rsquo;s book). For the things I enjoyed more, I allocated larger chunks of time, so that it was a more difficult investment and didn&rsquo;t become a default action. That way I never prioritize only the things that are easier or more enjoyable because I&rsquo;ve made the harder or less enjoyable things less daunting or more attainable.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="li3"><strong>How to be true to flow: </strong></li>
            <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li3">If you pick out a task and feelings of resistance come up, ask yourself why:</li>
            <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li3">is the task too daunting? Trying lowering the time allocation - you can do ANYTHING for just 5 minutes.</li>
            <li class="li3">Is the task still too daunting? Maybe your energy just isn&rsquo;t there right now - be true to the energy that you&rsquo;re in. If you&rsquo;re in a creative mindset, maybe you&rsquo;re better off doing one of your learning or creating tasks; similarly if you&rsquo;re feeling very productive, you could pick one of your organizational or writing tasks. It is definitely okay to put the task back in the bag for a later time when the energy is there, and pick out another - just observe what tasks you&rsquo;re avoiding and ask yourself why.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="li3">If you find yourself done with the time you set for a task but still with energy to go on, add some more time! There&rsquo;s a balance between going deep and burning out, so just be aware of your state and if you feel like you can go deeper, do so until before you feel like you&rsquo;re burning out. Or, add another 30 minute chunk of that activity to your bag for later, and move on to your next activity.</li>
            <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li3">For example, I was actually pretty hooked within the first five minutes of reading Julie&rsquo;s book - so I went on to read it for 30 minutes and felt great about it!</li>
            <li class="li3">On the flip side, I finished my 60 minute coding task, but still had a lot more to code. I decided that to avoid burning out, I would just add another 45 minute coding task to my list and come back to it at a later time.</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="li3"><strong>A quick note on balancing structure and flow: </strong>F</li>
            <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li3">low is a state of complete absorption in the task at hand - a feeling athletes get during their sport, artists get when painting, and perhaps you get when you do something you love. It&rsquo;s being completely &ldquo;in the zone&rdquo;, losing track of time, enjoying the activity at hand, and sometimes even being so hyper-focused that you achieve an elevated level of productivity. You can create some structure to maximize your ability to get into flow (whether that means structure to get things you don&rsquo;t enjoy (or the &lsquo;behind the scenes&rsquo; of your life) out of the day so the remainder of time can be care-free, or structure to start and end your day like bookends to create a container for your flow state). Once you know you&rsquo;ve got some structure, or a container to play in, you can trust yourself and surrender into flow.</li>
            </ul>
            </ul>
            <li class="li3"><strong>How to determine when your bag&rsquo;s too full: </strong></li>
            <ul class="ul1">
            <li class="li3">Add up the times, to get a sense of how achievable it is. You may not want to be &lsquo;doing stuff&rsquo; for your whole day, for example. If my list added up to more than 30 hours of tasks, I would know that&rsquo;s not achievable or desireable for me. I know that I spend X amount of my day doing structured tasks or dealing with the things that randomly pop up each day - this may include my nightly hangout with my boyfriend, my morning classes, time to cook dinner or travel between places, a coffee chat with a friend, etc. all of that takes away from the unstructured time I can predictably say I have in a week.</li>
            <li class="li3">Then, see whether it fits with how you want to spend your time (in categories too! like learning, writing, mental health, physical health, etc. - you don&rsquo;t have to actually place them into categories, but scan the list when you&rsquo;re done and see if you overindex or underindex in any area you want to work on).</li>
            <li class="li3">Finally, you should not feel guilty about not finishing the bag - you always make just a little more trail mix than you need, just in case. Not every minute needs to be productive!</li>
            </ul>
            </ul>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3">&mdash;</p>
            <p class="p4"><strong>OTHER METHODS I&rsquo;VE TRIED AND HOW THEY RELATE</strong></p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3">This is a complement to a &lsquo;urgent tasks&rsquo; to do system. I&rsquo;ve tried written to do&rsquo;s, i&rsquo;ve tried computer lists, project plans, to-doist, trello, <a href="http://monday.com"><span class="s3">monday.com</span></a>, slack, bullet journals, etc. but they were all place to store my tasks/projects, not a way to think through how the tasks related to my energy or to one another&hellip; or to manage my unstructured time. They worked great though for the structured time or commitments! I also tried creating task tables with activities that I wanted to accomplish day by day, but I would just end up feeling bad at the end of the week when I didn&rsquo;t do the things I said I would, or when I kept carrying over activities from one day to the next coming to the next coming to the next.</p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3">I think the important thing is to find two complementary systems that can keep you organized in both structured and unstructured time. For some super organized or hyper-motivated people, one system may work for both. But for me, the &lsquo;professional work&rsquo; version of myself with external commitments was very different from the &lsquo;personal work&rsquo; side of me that had to rely on internal accountability: it was HARD!</p>
            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3"><strong>So how I structure this: </strong>TODOIST is where i put things I have to do. My trailmix bag is for things i want to do. Todoist has my urgent deadlines and &lsquo;don&rsquo;t forget to do X&rsquo;s. My trailmix bag is about the things that I believe will help me grow, increase my happiness, and break down things I have to do in a way that serves what i want to do. it&rsquo;s not a to-do list; it&rsquo;s not for urgent things - my to-do list complements it for thsoe things. It&rsquo;s a time and goal management systsem and productivity method.</p>
            <p class="p5">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3"><strong>My week looks like this: </strong>Sunday nights I create my bag for the week, then I cook dinner, hang out with my boyfriend, and go to bed. Monday morning I wake up and deal with some to-do&rsquo;s: I answer my email, cook breakfast, respond to social media messages, and have my therapy or coaching appointment. Then I&rsquo;ve cleared my plate of all the noise and clutter, and have true free time to play. I open up my notebook and pick the first bullet where my eyes settle. I usually go through 2-3 activities in a sitting - I kinda just look at the time and estimate the amount of time I&rsquo;ll need. I usually move on between tasks, but sometimes will add time if I&rsquo;m in a good flow. Then I jump out to my afternoon coffees, gym, other miscellaneous commitments, and may have some free time after dinner to do another few activities.</p>
            <p class="p5">&nbsp;</p>

            <p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="p3">Also huge shoutout to my coach Danna Rubin for helping me find this method that has completely changed how I structure my unstructured sabbatical time and simultaneously surrender into flow and serendipity :)</p>
