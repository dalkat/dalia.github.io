            <p><i><SMALL>I'm excited to share with you all a little 'productivity' tool that's helped me navigate my free time in a way that feels equally productive, whimsical, and fun. I think it'll be useful for others that have unstructured time in their lives as well, whether due to a sabbatical, self-employed / flexible jobs, or the weekend! Below is a bit about how this method came about, how it's helped me, and how to try it in your own routine! For inspiration, I created a digital worksheet version of what my notebook looks like so you can find a structure that works for you. </SMALL></i></p>

	        <p><h2><strong>The Trail Mix Method</strong></h2></p>
	        <p><h2>Introduction</h2>
	        <p>As a recovering type-A, I've long struggled with the balance between structure and flow, or control and <a href="https://amzn.to/2tEqj3V" target="_blank">surrender</a>, and this struggle was <i>completely</i> magnified when I quit my job last fall and embarked on my 'creative sabbatical'. With all this new unstructured time, I didn't feel great about how my time was being spent: I wanted to find a way to work on myself and my goals or aspirations on my own clock, but different things I tried either felt overly stifling or so free that I'd get decision paralysis. Sound familiar to anyone?</p>
            <p>It was after a trip to Patagonia that I tested a technique that has allowed me to make a playbox of my time; a time management and productivity tool that allowed me to draw on my energy rather than on discipline to get what I wanted to get done, done, and it's what I call now: the Trail Mix Method. </p>
            <p>Enduring the weight of a loaded 40L backpack, 40mph winds that knocked me off my feet, and long uphill trails in Patagonia, trail mix gave me energy during my weeklong trek far greater and longer-lasting than any of the energy bars or gels that I had brought with me. Packed with healthy fats, fiber, antioxidants, long-lasting calories, and proteins, the trail mix was the perfect balance of everything in it: just the right amount of sweet to savory, of raisins to M&Ms, etc., and I got exactly what I needed each time I reached into the bag. It was the perfect balance of determining what was in the bag and then trusting that whatever I scooped up each time would be delicious and give me the energy I needed.</p>
            <p>When I got back from my trip and opened up my laptop to get some work done, a question popped into my head: what might a trail mix bag may look like for the things I want to do with my free time each week?</p>
            <p>I&rsquo;ve started using a metaphoric trail mix bag to manage my energy and unstructured time, and this 'productivity' method has completely transformational for me. It&rsquo;s changed how I understand and honor my own energy and flow rather than creating resistance, has removed decision paralysis in the context of abundant time and opportunity, and has helped me come through on daunting tasks that I&rsquo;ve put aside for months &mdash; and some, years.</p>
            <p>It's been an amazing tool for me in getting through even the toughest of treks, and I hope you might find some inspiration from it too!

             </p>

            <p><h2>What is the Trail Mix Method</h2></p>
            <p>In a nutshell (ha), the Trail Mix Method is an technique that helps structure unstructured time in a flexible way that better understands and manages your energy, rather than relying on discipline alone. In the same way that literal trail mix is a balanced mix of different bite-sized goodies, your Trail Mix Method bag is a mixed pool of different activities, ideas, and goals, each in little bite-size amounts that balance one another, that you can draw on during free moments.</p>


            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><h5>HOW IT'S HELPED</h5></p>
            <p>With so much free time at my hands, I had a few things to overcome. First, as someone who's always thinking of new projects or interests to explore, I often found myself struggling to start daunting tasks (I'm what some call a creative procrastinator) or to finish them (I'd lose inspiration). Both felt very much like an uphill battle. Second, as someone who sits between Type A and Type B, I wanted to work toward the things I wanted in a way that balanced structure and flow so I wouldn't end up feeling either trapped or aimless. I think part of why Trail Mixing has worked so well for me is that it was true to the spirit of my sabbatical: it was super simple, flexible, fun, and driven by curiousity! If this resonates with you, hopefully this can be an awesome tool for too!</p>	


            <p>My Trail Mix Bag has helped me turn my unstructured time into playbox of time where I could work on myself and my goals / aspirations on my own clock, as well as try things outside of my comfort zone. It's helped me finally come through I&rsquo;ve put aside for almost a year &mdash; like reading my high school teacher's new book, applying for a program I was excited about, finishing my first sabbatical post, building my online portfolio, and even... meditating. It's made daunting tasks more accessible, has helped me feed all my energy sources to prevent burnout, and has given me a crutch to lean on in moments of decision paralysis where I have a lot of free time and a lot of things I <i>could</i> do but don't know where to start. 

			
			<p>Probably my favorite outcome though is that it has enabled me to expand and harness energy instead of expending it as I do when I use discipline to get things done &mdash; which means I could save that discipline for the things I <i>have</i> to do in my structured time. The Trail Mix Method became the perfect balance between control (i.e., creating the bag, having a crutch) and flow or surrender (i.e., trusting whatever handful I pick out).</p>


            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><h5>WHERE IT FITS INTO MY LIFE</h5></p>

            <p>I'd tried a few other approaches to 'managing' or giving some direction to my unstructured time. While those approaches were great for managing my structured time (time-sensitive tasks, doctor's appointments, external commitments, project deadlines, etc.), I needed a complementary system for my unstructured time - time where I had no time-bound or even external commitments, only commitments to myself. </p>

            <p>On the one hand, I tried doing what worked in my 'work' life by adding tons of structure: using to-do list apps to manage my tasks, setting day-by-day goals, or blocking a recurring time on my calendar. I tried techniques such as Pomodoro to make that structure feel less intense. However, it still felt too rigid and relied too much on disclipline, which meant that it took away much of my excitement and energy, or worse: made me feel guilty for not accomplishing my goals. On the other hand, I tried just going with the flow and deciding what to do in the moment. I wound up defaulting into what felt easiest or top-of-mind, and would usually go all in on that thing for hours or days... which led to me being feeling burnt out because I was forgetting about my other energy needs.</p>

            <p>Trail Mix Method became the perfect way to play and get things done in my unstructured time, while also complementing how I managed my structured time, for which I used my calendar and <a href="https://todoist.com/r/daliakatan_nciojm" target="_blank">to-do list</a> app. I'd keep it in a little notebook in my pocket at all times, and whenever a free moment arose in between my responsibilities for the day, or whenever I needed a burst of energy, I'd pick an activity out of my Trail Mix Bag.
            </p>

            <p><h2>Making Your Trail Mix Bag</strong></h2></p>

            <p><h5>OVERVIEW</h5></p>
            <p>Like trail mix, your Trail Mix bag may have a broad mix of activities &mdash; perhaps ideas you want to pursue, skills you want to explore, or even inner personas you want to feel into. Also like a trail mix bag, you put it together once at the beginning of the week or a trip, and then accept whatever comes out of it.&nbsp; Each &lsquo;bite-size&rsquo; activity you draw will be the burst of energy you need to do the task.</p>
            <p>Once a week, you set aside 1 hour to build your trail mix bag (upfront structure) by filling it with the activities, goals, or projects that you want to work on or manifest in your unstructured time that week. Then, in your free moments throughout the week, you'll reach into your &lsquo;bag&rsquo; and pick out an activity for that moment. Since this is a tool for unstructured time, it doesn't matter what you pick out, since the things you draw are things you want to do for yourself that can happen today, tomorrow, or end of the week.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p><h5>CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUR TRAIL MIX BAG</h5></p>
            
            <p><strong>Mixed and balanced</strong><br>Your bag has a ton of things you want to do (or dreaded but good-for-you things). There's a lot of variety without too much of any one item, which brings balance. The beauty of balance is that it helps prevent burnout, as you think about how the activities relate to one another and to your energy. For example, in the same way that you wouldn't want literal trail mix to be all raisins, your Trail Mix Method bag has a mix of activities in different categories such as learning, health & wellness, and organization.</p>

            <p><strong>Bite-sized</strong><br>
            Your bag is made up of little bits of each of the activities. Rather than being project-based, activities are energy-based and are broken into small time chunks, just enough to give you a little burst of energy each time. Not every activity has the same amount of time because not every task has the same amount of energy or excitement behind it. For example, rather than setting a goal of finishing a book, you might set 30 minutes of that activity, and for activities that seem unreachable, you might set only 5 minutes - just enough of a nudge to get you started on an intimdiating project when starting is the hardest part.</p>

            <p><strong>Build and let go</strong><br>
            Your bag represents a balance between controlling and structuring your container, and then surrendering and trusting the bag you&rsquo;ve built: having blind faith that whatever you need will show up. Remember that <i>you</i> made the bag, and you were thinking about what you wanted to do &mdash; when you made it, coming from a place of empowerment, clarity, inspiration, so trust yourself!</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><h5>THE WEEKLY RITUAL OF CREATING YOUR TRAIL MIX BAG</h5></p>
            <p>This is where the little bit of upfront structure and discipline comes in to help you surrender throughout the week. I schedule an hour chunk every Sunday night that I call &lsquo;Trail Mix Sunday&rsquo; where I create my bag for the week. Doesn&rsquo;t matter when you do this (morning, night, Sunday, Wednesday) but ideally whenever you feel your week starts so you can plan for the week. I don't usually need the full hour, but I use any extra time to knock off a few items from my list. For your first Trail Mix Sunday, you'll need the full time to set up your system and create your first bag.&nbsp;</p>
            <br>
            
            <p><strong>Your first time</strong></p>
            <p><ol>
            <li><strong>5-minutes, meditation.</strong> Take a moment to settle your mind - whether just by focusing on your breath or by trying a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/diane-yeo/guided-meditation-by-diane-yeo" target="_blank">guided meditation</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>5-minutes, intentions.</strong> Grab a pen and your notebook or a sheet of paper, and record your intention for this Trail Mix bag: why are you doing this? What do you hope this tool will give you? What do you want more of in your life? </li>
            <li><strong>5-minutes, build your bag.</strong> Determine what your 'bag' looks like - any physical form (not digital) will work, such as a zip-lock bag or bowl filled with fortune-cookie-sized paper, a <a href="https://amzn.to/2SvquZE" target="_blank">moleskine notebook</a> of half sheet of paper with columns of bullets, or <a href="https://daliakatan.com/TMM" target="_blank">this template</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>15-minutes, category goals.</strong> Reflect on the following question: what are the areas in your life that you want to invest your energy? Write down 5-8 categories that resonate with you to start, and keep them in an easy to access space, such as your wall or at the front of your notebook, so you can refer to them each week during your Trail Mix ritual. Some examples: Reading, Hobbies, Health & Wellbeing, Creative Creation, Learning & Development, Community, Income Generation, Personas, Organization &mdash; and the list goes on. </li> 
              <img src="/img/content/trailmixcategories.png" style="width: auto;">
            </ol></p>
            <br>
            
            <p><strong>Your weekly ritual</strong></p>
            <p><i>If it's your first week, skip to step 3; if it's your weekly ritual, start on step 1.</i></p>
            <p><ol>
            <li><strong>5-minute meditation.</strong> Take a moment to settle your mind - whether just by focusing on your breath or by trying a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/diane-yeo/guided-meditation-by-diane-yeo" target="_blank">guided meditation</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>5-minutes, intentions.</strong> Grab a pen and your notebook or a sheet of paper, and set your intention for this week: what do you want to feel, create, or channel? What do you want to give yourself?</li>
            <li><strong>5-minutes, reflection.</strong> Reflect on last week's trail mix bag. What did you easily accomplish? What was harder to accomplish? What was left untouched in the bag? Circle or write down any items that were particularly difficult or remained untouched &mdash; ask yourself: why was there resistance? Was the task too daunting? Identify 'leftovers' that you want to postpone for a future week, and for those you want to carry over into this week's bag, add them to your new list.</li>
            <li><strong>20-minutes, fill a new bag.</strong> Go through your Category Goals sheet you created during your first Trail Mix Sunday, and for each category, reflect on your intentions for that category for the week. Then, add a few activities you want to direct your energy toward this week into your bag. Make them bite-sized by adding a time allocation between 5 and 60 minutes, depending on how difficult or intimidating a task is (less time) or how easy or enjoyable it is (more time). This allocation makes a small difficult task equally attractive as a long easy task, giving everything in your bag equal weighting (balance). If you want to do it multiple times that week, or if it's a task that will require more time to complete, add multiple bullets with the same activity.<br>For example: 10 minutes - Read Julie's book. 60 minutes - code personal website. 30 minutes - yoga. 10 minutes - Read Julie's book (repeat).</li>
            <li><strong>5-minutes, zoom out.</strong> Take a step back and see whether your bag is mixed, balanced, and achievable this week. You can do a rough add-up of the times to get a general sense of how achievable it is and whether your categories feel generally balanced. For example, you may not want to be 'doing stuff' for more than 20 hours of the week, or you may know that 6 hours of your day are already busy with structured commitments or social time. </li></ol></p>


            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Trail Mix in your day-to-day</strong></p>
            <p>Throughout the week, when you find yourself in a moment of unstructured time, reach into your 'bag' and complete the activity you draw, crossing it off when it's completed. This may require a bit of discipline, but it's all about trusting that you've built the bag with only things you feel you can do. I usually complete 2-3 activities in a sitting, but how much or how little you do is up to you as you discover your balance between productive time and plain old down-time.</p>

            <p>Finally, you should not feel guilty about not finishing the bag at the end of the week, as we need down time in our weeks too! Having time to do 'nothing' or be <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/manoush_zomorodi_how_boredom_can_lead_to_your_most_brilliant_ideas?referrer=playlist-why_it_s_sometimes_good_to_be_bored" target="_blank">bored</a> allows your mind to reset and reflect, and is just as important to your growth journey :)</p>

            <p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2></p>

            <p><strong>Tip on going for longer</strong></p>
            <p>If you find yourself done with the time you set for a task but still with energy to go on or deep in flow: feel out your energy! There's a balance between going deep and burning out - your enthusiasm may pull you for longer than an hour, but doing so can begin to drain your energy. You can always add another chunk of that activity to your bag for later and move on to your next activity! Flow is beautiful and hyperproductive, but it is not fleeting :)</p>

        	<p><strong>Tip on handling resistance</strong></p>
            <p>On the flip-side, if the activity you draw raises some resistance, ask yourself: why? Is the task too daunting? Trying lowering the time allocation — you can do ANYTHING for just 5 minutes. Is the task still too daunting? Maybe your energy just isn’t there right now. Be true to the energy that you’re in. For example, if you’re in a creative mindset, maybe you’re better off doing one of your learning or creating tasks; similarly if you’re feeling very focused, you could pick one of your organizational or physical tasks. You can put the task back in the bag for a later time when the energy is there, and pick out another &mdash; just observe what tasks you’re repeatedly avoiding and ask yourself why. </p>

                <p><strong>Tip on graduating your Trail Mix Bag from unstructured to structured</strong></p>
            <p>One of my happiest outcomes of Trail Mix Method is that I found myself so successful in accomplishing certain activities that I ended up graduating some of them from my unstructured time into my scheduled routine. For example, I found that it was so easy for me to complete income-building activities, that I ended up adding one hour at the beginning of every day where I only focused on income-generating activities, thus creating more space in my bag for other goals. I think that's part of the beauty of the energy-based nature of this method: it's helping me build habits or eventual accountability!</p>
