	        <p><h2><strong>The Trail Mix Method</strong></h2></p>
	        <p><h2>Introduction</h2>
	        <p>As a recovering type-A, I've long struggled with the balance between structure and flow, or control and <a href="https://amzn.to/2tEqj3V" target="_blank">surrender</a>, and this struggle was <i>completely</i> magnified when I quit my job last fall and embarked on my 'creative' sabbatical. With all this new unstructured time, I didn't feel great about how my time was being spent: I wanted to find a way to work on myself and my goals or aspirations on my own clock, but different things I tried either felt overly stifling or so free that I'd get decision paralysis. Sound familiar to anyone?</p>
            <p>It was after a trip to Patagonia that I tested a technique that has allowed me to make a playbox of my time; a time management and productivity tool that allowed me to draw on my energy rather than on discipline to get what I wanted to get done, done, and it's what I call now: the Trail Mix Method. </p>
            <p>Enduring the weight of a loaded 40L backpack, 40mph winds that swept me off my feet, and long uphill trails in Patagonia, trail mix gave me energy during my weeklong trek far greater and longer-lasting than any of the energy bars or gus that I had brought with me. Packed with healthy fats, fiber, antioxidants, long-lasting calories, and proteins, the trail mix was the perfect balance of everything in it: just the right amount of sweet to savory, of raisins to M&Ms, etc., and I got exactly what I needed each time I reached into the bag. It was the perfect balance of determining what was in the bag and then trusting that whatever I scooped up each time would be delicious and give me the energy I needed.</p>
            <p>When I got back from my trip and opened up my laptop to get some work done, a question popped into my head: what might a trail mix bag may look like for the things I want to do with my free time each week?</p>
            <p>I&rsquo;ve started using a metaphoric trail mix bag to manage my energy and unstructured time, and this 'productivity' method has completely transformational for me. It&rsquo;s changed how I understand and honor my own energy and flow rather than creating resistance, has removed decision paralysis in the context of abundant time and opportunity, and has helped me come through on daunting tasks that I&rsquo;ve put aside for months &mdash; and some, years. It's been an amazing tool for me, and I hope you might find some inspiration from it too!

             </p>

            <blockquote><h3 style="line-height: 1.4;color: #ff9900;"><b>Question:</b> Where in your life do you feel you have unstructured time? What have you enjoyed about that time? What challenges have you found with how you spend that time?</h3></blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>



            <p><h2>What is the Trail Mix Method</h2></p>
            <p>The Trail Mix Method is an technique that helps structure unstructured time in a flexible way that better understands and manages your energy, rather than relying on discipline alone. In the same way that literal trail mix is a balanced mix of different bite-sized goodies, your Trail Mix Method bag is a mixed pool of different activities, ideas, and goals, each in little bite-size amounts that balance one another, that you can draw on during free moments.</p>


            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><h5>WHO IT MAY WORK FOR</h5></p>
            <p>I have tons of unstructured time during my sabbatical, and I believe it can be helpful for others with free over the weekend and for part-time / flexible jobs too. I'm going to describe myself below, and if any of this resonates, perhaps the Trail Mix Method will be as life-changing for you as it has been for me! 
            <p><ul>
            <li>Sit somewhere between Type A and Type B, or aspire to be there (type "Be" as my friend Tim calls it!), and are struggling to balance structure and flow</li>
            <li>Have no problem finding new projects, interests, or goals, but sometimes struggle to either start on daunting tasks (I'm a creative procrastinator) or finish them (lose inspiration)</li>
            <li>When I have no structure, I tend to default into the most accessible or top-of-mind way to spend my time, and then go all in and burn out</li>
            <li>When I have too much structure, I feel drained and stuck, moving the same goals or to-do&rsquo;s on next week&rsquo;s list, every week&nbsp;</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><h5>HOW IT HELPED</h5></p>
            <p>The Trail Mix Method is super simple and flexible, which is part of why it's worked so well in helping me better understand and manage my energy, regain autonomy over my time, and accomplish goals I&rsquo;ve put aside for almost a year &mdash; like reading my high school teacher's new book, applying for a program I was excited about, finishing my first sabbatical post, building my online portfolio, and even... meditating.</p>

            <p>I'd tried a few other approaches to 'managing' or giving some direction to my unstructured or free time. On the one hand, I tried just going with the flow, just being present and deciding what to do in the moment. It was so unstructured that it led me to defaulting into what felt easy or most accessible: I'd go all in for hours or days on projects I was excited about only to come out burnt out because I wasn't feeding my other energy needs. On the other hand, I tried adding tons of structure: using to-do list apps to manage my tasks, setting day-by-day goals, or blocking a recurring time on my calendar. It was too structured, relied on disclipline alone, took away all of my excitement and energy, and sometimes worse: made me feel guilty for not accomplishing my goals.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>While those approaches were great for managing my structured time (time-sensitive tasks, doctor's appointments, external commitments, project deadlines, etc.), I needed a complementary system for my unstructured time - time where I had no time-bound or even external commitments, only commitments to myself. Trail Mix Method became the perfect complement to my calendar and to-do app.</p>

            <p>My Trail Mix Bag helped me turn my unstructured time into playbox of time where I could work on myself and my goals / aspirations on my own clock, as well as try things outside of my comfort zone. It made daunting tasks more accessible, helped me feed all my energy sources to prevent burnout, and gave me a crutch to lean on in moments of decision paralysis - where I had a lot of free time and a lot of things I <i>could</i> do but didn't know where to start. It also freed up plenty of time to just do 'nothing' sometimes and allow my mind to reset and reflection in <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/manoush_zomorodi_how_boredom_can_lead_to_your_most_brilliant_ideas?referrer=playlist-why_it_s_sometimes_good_to_be_bored" target="_blank">boredom</a>.</p>

            <p>Probably my favorite part of it though is that it enabled me to expand and harness energy instead of expending it as I do when I use discipline to get things done &mdash; which means I could save that discipline for the things I <i>had</i> to do in my structured time. The Trail Mix Method became the perfect balance between structure (i.e., creating the bag, having a crutch) and flow or surrender (trusting that whatever handful I pick out will be perfect for the moment).</p>

            <p><h2>Making Your Trail Mix Bag</strong></h2></p>

            <p><h5>OVERVIEW</h5></p>
            <p>As mentioned above, the Trail Mix Method is an energy management technique. Like trail mix, it has a mix of activities broken down into bite-size quantities, with balance between all the activities that make it up. These activities may be ideas you want to pursue, skills you want to explore, or even inner personas you want to feel into. Also like a trail mix bag, you put it together once, and then accept whatever comes out of it.&nbsp; Throughout the week when you have a free moment, you'll pull out something from the trail mix bag to use that time for.&nbsp;Each &lsquo;bite-size&rsquo; activity you draw will be the burst of energy you need to do the task.</p>
            <p>Once a week, you set aside 1 hour to build your trail mix bag (upfront structure) by filling it with goals, projects, personas, etc. that you want to work on or manifest in your unstructured time that week; then in your free moments, you reach into your &lsquo;bag&rsquo; and pick out the task you&rsquo;re going to do in that moment. Emphasis on unstructured time: this isn&rsquo;t a tool to manage deadlines or urgent tasks &mdash; that stuff belongs on your calendar or in your To-do app; this is about things you want to do for yourself that can happen today, tomorrow, or end of the week.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p><h5>CHARACTERISTICS OF YOU TRAIL MIX BAG</h5></p>
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Mixed and balanced: </strong>Your bag has a ton variety of things you want to do (or dreaded but good-for-you things), rather than being full of just one thing (For example, with literal trail mix, you wouldn't want a bag of only raisins!) It also balanced in that it doesn't have too much of any one thing. This helps prevent burnout because you think about how the activities relate to one another, how they relate to your energy, and don't overemphasize one particular area. For example, a balance of 'learning' related activities to 'health &amp; wellness', 'organizational', etc.</li>

            <li><strong>Bite-sized:</strong> Your bag has little bits of each of the activities: rather than being project-based, activities are energy-based and are broken into small time chunks. They are little bursts of energy, and sometimes just enough of a nudge to get you started on an intimdiating project when starting is the hardest part. Not every activity has the same amount of time because not every task has the same amount of energy or excitement behind it. (For example, 30 minutes of an activity rather than its entirety, and only 5 minutes for activities or goals that seem unreachable) See FAQ below for tips.</li>

            <li><strong>Trust yourself and then let go:</strong> Your bag represents a balance between control and structuring your container, and then surrendering and trusting the bag you&rsquo;ve built: having blind faith that whatever you need will show up. Trust yourself and then surrender to yourself. Remember that you made the bag, and you were thinking about what you wanted to do &mdash; when you made it, you were coming from a place of empowerment, clarity, inspiration, so trust that past version of yourself!</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><h5>THE WEEKLY RITUAL OF CREATING YOUR TRAIL MIX BAG</h5></p>
            <p>This is where the little bit of upfront structure and discipline comes in to help you surrender throughout the week. I schedule an hour chunk every Sunday night that I call &lsquo;Trail Mix Sunday&rsquo; where I create my bag for the week. Doesn&rsquo;t matter when you do this (morning, night, Sunday, Wednesday) but ideally whenever you feel your week starts so you can plan for the week. I don't usually need the full hour, but I use any extra time to knock off a few items from my list. For your first Trail Mix Sunday, you'll need the full time to set up your system and create your first bag.&nbsp;</p>
            <br>
            
            <p><strong>Your first time: </strong></p>
            <p><ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1: 5-minute meditation.</strong> Take a moment to settle your mind. It's okay to let it wander, but try to bring it back to your breath, observing the sensations in your body as you inhale and exhale. If you prefer a guided experience, click <a href="https://soundcloud.com/diane-yeo/guided-meditation-by-diane-yeo" target="_blank">here</a> for a guided meditation.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: 5-minute intentions.</strong> Set your intention for this Trail Mix bag: why are you doing this? What do you hope this tool will give you? What do you want more of in your life?</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: 15-minute category goals.</strong> Create category goals on a paper or in a notebook. Gather a notebook or a few sheets of paper, and a pen. Reflect on the following question: what are the areas in your life that you want to invest your energy? This is a reference that you will use every Sunday for your TM ritual. Some examples may be: Reading, Hobbies, Health &amp; Wellbeing, Creative Content, Learning and Development, Community, Income Generation, Personas, Organization &mdash; and the list goes on. Pick about 5-8 categories that resonate with you to start, and keep them in an easy to access space &mdash; whether on your wall or at the front of your notebook, so you can refer to them each week.</li> 
              <img src="/img/content/trailmixcategories.png" style="width: auto;">
            <li><strong>Step 4: Pick your bag.</strong> Determine what your 'bag' looks like - any physical form (not digital) will work, such as a zip-lock bag or bowl filled with fortune-cookie-sized paper, a <a href="https://amzn.to/2SvquZE" target="_blank">moleskine notebook</a>, or <a href="https://daliakatan.com/TMM" target="_blank">this template</a>. Once you've figure out the form, think of a structure that works for you: you could use fortune cookie sized paper in a jar or zip lock bag, or you could use columns of bullets on a sheet of paper.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <br>
            
            <p><strong>Your weekly ritual:</strong></p>
            <p><i>If it's your first week, skip to step 3; if it's your weekly ritual, start on step 1.</i></p>
            <p><ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1: 5-minute meditation.</strong> Take a moment to settle your mind. It's okay to let it wander, but try to bring it back to your breath, observing the sensations in your body as you inhale and exhale. If you prefer a guided experience, click <a href="https://soundcloud.com/diane-yeo/guided-meditation-by-diane-yeo" target="_blank">here</a> for a guided meditation.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: 5-minute intentions.</strong> Set your intention for this week: what do you want to feel, create, or channel? What do you want to give yourself?</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: Reflection.</strong> Reflect on last week's trail mix bag. What did you easily accomplish? What was harder to accomplish? What was left untouched in the bag? Circle any items that were particularly difficult, or 'leftovers' that you want to postpone for a future week. For the items that were difficult to accomplish or remained untouched, ask yourself: why was there resistance? Was the task too daunting? For the items you want to carry over into this week's bag, add them to your list.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4: Build a new bag.</strong> Go through your Category Goals sheet you created during your first Trail Mix Sunday, and for each category, reflect on your intentions for that category for the week. Then, add a few activities you want to direct your energy toward this week into your bag. Make them bite sized (see tips below) by adding a time allocation between 5 and 60 minutes, depending on how difficult or intimidating a task is (less time) or how easy or enjoyable it is (more time). This allocation makes a small difficult task equally attractive as a long easy task. If you want to do it multiple times that week, or if it's a task that will require more time to complete, add another bullet.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5: Zoom out.</strong> Take a step back and see whether your bag is mixed, balanced, and achievable this week (see tips below)</li>
            </ul></p>
            <br>
            
            <p><strong>Trail Mix in your day-to-day:</strong></p>
            <p>Throughout the week, when you find yourself in a moment of unstructured time, reach into your 'bag' and complete the activity you draw, crossing it off when it's completed. This may require a bit of discipline, but it's all about trusting that you've built the bag with only things you feel you can do. I usually complete 2-3 activities in a sitting, but how much or how little you do is up to you as you discover your balance between productive time and plain old down-time.</p>
            <p>If the activity you draw raises some resistence, feel free to pick a different one, but ask yourself: why? (See FAQ for tips)</p>

            <h2>FAQ + Tips to create an effective Trail Mix System</h2><br>
            <p><strong>Q: What does the &lsquo;bag&rsquo; look like?</strong></p>
            <p>How you choose to form your bag is up to you, but the guiding principle is that you should use something physical (i.e., not on your computer). The reason for that is that lists on a computer don't have as much thoughtfulness and are too easy to manipulate after you&rsquo;ve set it.
              <ul>
              <li>If you're new to the surrender journey, you may choose a half of a sheet of paper with bullets for the activities. I personally keep mine in <a href="https://amzn.to/2SvquZE" target="_blank">a moleskine notebook</a> but you can also use a printout of <a href="https://daliakatan.com/TMM" target="_blank">this template</a> I've created for you. While a list isn&rsquo;t as whimsical as a bag, it allows you to adjust which activity you &lsquo;pick out&rsquo; based on where my energetic state is (creative activities versus cerebral, physical, etc.) and how much time I have in that moment.</li>
              <li>You may choose to use a literal zip-lock bag or bowl with pieces of fortune-cookie-sized paper in it. Now THAT&rsquo;s true surrender!</li>
              <li>If you're coding savvy, you could even design a generator or script that handles it for you, similar to <a href="https://daliakatan.com/do-now" target="_blank">this project</a> that was a predecessor to the Trail Mix Method. If you do create a tool, please share it!</li></ul>
            </p><br>
            
            <p><strong>Q: How do I make activities 'bite-sized'?</strong></p>
            <p>As mentioned above, activities are not project-based (e.g., finish reading X, or write 1 blog post) but energy-based. When I was hiking, trail mix would give me about 15-30 minute bursts of energy, and I found that that was actually a great baseline to break down activities. The bite-sized nature also made tasks more achievable, helping me just get started when all I needed was a five-minute nudge. For example: 10 minutes - Read Julie&rsquo;s book. 60 minutes - code personal website. 30 minutes - yoga.
              <ul><li><b>Activities can last longer but YOU decide if they do.</b> If you see yourself in flow, you can choose to take that extra M&M or to extend your current task! However, it's also important to pull yourself out from going too deep to avoid burnout or imbalance, setting some maximum parameters). Flow is beautiful and hyperproductive, but it is not fleeting! You can get back into it at a later time.&nbsp;.&nbsp; if you get into &lsquo;flow state&rsquo; or a hyper productive mode and want to do more, you can; and if not, you&rsquo;ve come through on a small commitment, congratulate yourself and you move on to the next one.</li>
              <li><b>The goal is to build a bag where everything has equal priority or desirability.</b> If some things are more desirable than others, you'll end up wanting to do only those things. So, to give all the activities equal weighting/value in the trail mix bag, I balance the enjoyment of an activity and the time it&rsquo;s allocated. For the things that I enjoyed less or that we&rsquo;re more daunting, I would lower the time allocated to it, so it became an easier investment (e.g., I hate reading, so 10 minutes felt like a safe commitment to reading Julie&rsquo;s book). For the things I enjoyed more, I allocated larger chunks of time, so that it was a more difficult investment and didn&rsquo;t become a default action. That way I never prioritize only the things that are easier or more enjoyable because I&rsquo;ve made the harder or less enjoyable things less daunting or more attainable.&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
            </p><br>

            <p><strong>Q: How do I determine when my bag's too full, and what do I do with "leftovers"?</strong></p>
              <p><ul>
              <li><b>When creating your bag, add up the times to get a general sense of how achievable it is.</b> You may not want to be &lsquo;doing stuff&rsquo; for 40 hours of the week, for example. Personally, if my list added up to more than 20 hours of tasks, I would know that&rsquo;s not achievable or desireable for me. I know that I spend about 2 hours each day doing structured tasks and at least 2-3 hours dealing with the things that randomly pop up each day &mdash; this may include my nightly hangout with my boyfriend, my morning classes, time to cook dinner or travel between places, a coffee chat with a friend, etc. All of those scheduled or pop-up activities takes away from the unstructured time I can predictably say I have in a week.&nbsp;</li>
              <li><b>After you check if this fits with how much time you want to spend productive, see whether it fits with where you want to spend your time,</b> such as in categories like learning, writing, mental health, or physical health. You don&rsquo;t have to actually place them into categories, but scan the list when you&rsquo;re done and see if you overindex or underindex in any area you want to work on).&nbsp;</li>
              <li><b>Finally, you should not feel guilty about not finishing the bag.</b> After all, you always make just a little more trail mix than you need, just in case. Not every minute needs to be productive! The goal is not to finish an entire bag in a week, but to have some structure to lean on. Any leftovers will be reflected on in your next week, where you can determine if there just wasn't enough time to finish it, or if there as a resistence within you to completing that activity.</li>
              </ul>
            </p><br>

            <p><strong>Q: What is flow, how do I honor my flow, and how can I minimize resistence and burnout?</strong></p>
            <p>Flow is a state of complete absorption in the task at hand: a feeling athletes get during their sport, artists get when painting, and perhaps you get when you do something you love or are really good at. It&rsquo;s being completely &ldquo;in the zone&rdquo;, losing track of time, enjoying the activity at hand, and sometimes even being so hyper-focused that you achieve an elevated level of productivity.</p>
            <p>You can create some structure to maximize your ability to get into flow (whether that means structure to get things you don&rsquo;t enjoy, or the &lsquo;behind the scenes&rsquo; of your life, out of the day so the remainder of time can be care-free, or structure to start and end your day like bookends to create a container for your flow state). Once you know you&rsquo;ve got some structure, or a container to play in, you can trust yourself and surrender (or let go of control) into flow.</p>
            <p>This method aims to be true to flow, and there are a few things that may come up in that process: 
              <ul>
              <li><b>If you pick out a task and feelings of resistance come up, ask yourself why:</b></li>
              <ul>
              <li>Is the task too daunting? Trying lowering the time allocation &mdash; you can do ANYTHING for just 5 minutes.&nbsp;</li>
              <li>Is the task still too daunting? Maybe your energy just isn&rsquo;t there right now. Be true to the energy that you&rsquo;re in. If you&rsquo;re in a creative mindset, maybe you&rsquo;re better off doing one of your learning or creating tasks; similarly if you&rsquo;re feeling very productive, you could pick one of your organizational or writing tasks. It is definitely okay to put the task back in the bag for a later time when the energy is there, and pick out another &mdash; just observe what tasks you&rsquo;re avoiding and ask yourself why.&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
              <li><b>If you find yourself done with the time you set for a task but still with energy to go on:</b></li>
              <ul>
              <li>You can add some more time, or add another chunk of that activity to your bag for later and move on to your next activity! </li>
              <li>Remember: there&rsquo;s a balance between going deep and burning out, so just be aware of your state. Exceeding one hour is usually when energy can begin to drain &mdash; your enthusiasm may pull you for longer than an hour, but doing so can burn you out. Just feel out your stopping point. </li>
              <li>For example, I was actually pretty hooked within the first five minutes of reading Julie&rsquo;s book, so I went on to read it for 30 minutes and felt great about it! On the flip side, I finished my 60-minute coding task, but still had a lot more to code. Remembering that the last time I coded for longer than an hour I felt mentally drained and anxious for the rest of the day, I decided I would just add another 45 minute coding task to my list and come back to it at a later time.&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
              </ul>

            <p><strong>Tip on Graduating your Trail Mix Bag from Unstructured to Structured:</strong></p>
            <p>Sometimes, you'll find yourself so successful in accomplishing certain activities that you may want to move them into your scheduled routine. For example: I used to have an activity called &ldquo;20m - dance&rdquo; on my trail mix bag, and I enjoyed it so much that I decided to sign up for a salsa class every Friday afternoon. Similarly, I found that I was so good at doing income-building activities, that I ended up adding one hour at the beginning of every day where I only focused on income-generating activities. Both are commitments I've made, and they've graduated from my trail mix bag to my calendar. That&rsquo;s part of the beauty of this method: helping build habits or eventual accountability!</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Other Methods I've Tried and How They Relate</h2>
            <p>It's important to find two complementary systems that can keep you organized in both structured and unstructured time. For some super-organized, ultra-disciplined, or hyper-motivated people, one system may work for both. But for me, the &lsquo;professional work&rsquo; version of myself with external commitments was very different from the &lsquo;personal work&rsquo; side of me that had to rely on internal accountability: it was HARD!</p>

        	<p>In trying to manage my unstructured time, I tried many different methods: written to do&rsquo;s, Notes lists, project plans, Todoist, Trello, Asana, Slack, Bullet Journals, etc. as well an managing time through Pomodoro, but they were all place to store my tasks/projects or tools to take breaks, not a way to think through how the tasks related to my energy or to one another&hellip; or to manage my unstructured time. I also tried creating task tables with activities that I wanted to accomplish day by day, but I would just end up feeling bad at the end of the week when I didn&rsquo;t do the things I said I would, or when I kept carrying over activities from one day to the next coming to the next coming to the next.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>

            <p>While these tools didn't work for my unstructured time, they worked great for the structured time or commitments or urgent to-do's, and I use them as a complement to my Trail Mix Method.</p>
            <p><strong>My structure: </strong>I use my trail mix bag for things I want to do, and I use ToDoist and my calendar for things I have to do or that are time sensitive. </p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Todoist has my time-sensitive deadlines, miscellaneous errands, and other reminders. </li>
                <li>My calendar has scheduled activities and social commitments, as well as some urgent tasks I need to schedule into my day. This represents the ultimate level of accountability for me &mdash; if it's in my calendar, I know it's disclipine I have to use. My calendar has four color-coded categories: Recurring errands (purple), social (yellow), income-building (pink), and all other (green).</li>
                <li>My Trail Mix bag is about the things that I believe will help me grow and increase my happiness, while also breaking down things I have to do in a way that serves me and my energy.</li>
            </ul></p>
