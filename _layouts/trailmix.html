	        <p><h2><strong>The Trail Mix Method</strong></h2></p>
	        <p><h2>Introduction</h2>
	        <p>As a recovering type-A, I've long struggled with the balance between structure and flow, or control and <a href="https://amzn.to/2GSwqte" target="_blank">surrender</a>, and this struggle was <i>completely</i> magnified when I quit my job last fall and embarked on my 'creative' sabbatical. With all this new unstructured time, I wanted to find a way to work on myself and my goals or aspirations on my own clock, but different things I tried either felt overly stifling or so free that I'd get decision paralysis. Sound familiar to anyone?</p>
            <p>It was after a trip to Patagonia that I discovered a technique that has allowed me to make a playbox of my time; a time management and productivity tool that allowed me to draw on my energy rather than on discipline to get what I wanted to get done, done, and it's what I call now: the Trail Mix Method. </p>
            <p>Enduring the weight of a loaded 40L backpack, 40mph winds that swept me off my feet, and long uphill trails in Patagonia, trail mix gave me energy during my weeklong trek far greater and longer-lasting than any of the energy bars or gus that I had brought with me. Packed with healthy fats, fiber, antioxidants, long-lasting calories, and proteins, the trail mix was the perfect balance of everything in it: just the right amount of sweet to savory, of raisins to M&Ms, etc., and I got exactly what I needed each time I reached into the bag. It was the perfect balance of controlling what was in the bag and blindly trusting that whatever I scooped up each time would be delicious.</p>
            <p>When I got back from my trip and opened up my laptop to get some work done, a question popped into my head: what might a trail mix bag may look like for the things I want to do with my free time each week?</p>
            <p>I&rsquo;ve started using a metaphoric trail mix bag to manage my energy and unstructured time, and this productivity method has completely transformational for me. It&rsquo;s changed how I understand and honor my own energy, rather than creating resistance, and has helped me come through on daunting tasks that I&rsquo;ve put aside for months. It's been an amazing tool for me, and I hope you might find some inspiration from it too!

            <blockquote><h3 style="line-height: 1.4;color: #ff9900;"><b>Question:</b> Where in your life do you feel you have unstructured time? What have you enjoyed about that time? What challenges have you found with how you spend that time?</h3></blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>



            <h2>Why it works so well and who should use it</h2>
            <p>The Trail Mix Method is an technique that helps you structure your unstructured time in a way that better understands and manages your energy. Like a trail mix bag, it&rsquo;s a mixed pool of different activities, ideas, and goals (i.e., it&rsquo;s not a bag of just M&Ms or just peanuts, but a mix!), each in little bite-size amounts that is balanced in it&rsquo;s components. It&rsquo;s simple, but it works, and 6 weeks into this little experiment I&rsquo;ve accomplished goals I&rsquo;ve put aside for months - like reading the book my high school teacher wrote, writing my application for a program I&rsquo;m excited about, meditating, or putting together my website. I've enjoyed it so much that my need for discipline has shifted from forcing myself to start something to stopping myself from overdoing it! For me, the Trail Mix Method represents balance between structure and flow, control and surrender - a balance of living between Type A and Type B. It is trusting the universe but doing your part too. A ritual of structuring the container, then release and surrender, trusting whatever happens.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><h5>First, what do I mean by unstructured time?</h5></p>
            <p>This is time where you have no time-bound external commitments - only commitments to yourself. This can be funemployed time, a sabbatical, or the weekend, but it&rsquo;s that playbox of time where you get to work on you and your goals or aspirations on your own clock. This kind of unstructured time does not need to be productive - and you shouldn&rsquo;t feel bad about doing &lsquo;nothing&rsquo; or not doing &lsquo;enough&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s all society&rsquo;s artificial construct of how we need to be spending our days. After all, moments of nothing or boredom give us time to reset and reflect.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><h5>Why the Trail Mix Method works so well</h5> </p>
            <p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;ve tried a few different ways to approach your unstructured or &lsquo;free&rsquo; time. You may have gone all in on a project for three very intense days, only to come out burnt out. (After all, we are multifaceted individuals and get energy from multiple sources!) You may have tried using Asana or Todoist to manage your tasks or creating day-by-day goals sheet. You may have blocked a recurring time on your calendar to force yourself to work on a certain goal, or maybe tried going with the flow - just being present and deciding what to do in the moment. If you&rsquo;re like me, these all fell short of working: they either felt too structured and took away all of your excitement and energy, or too unstructured such that you defaulted to what felt easy or what you know; they either made you feel exhausted and burn out, or made you feel guilty for not accomplishing your goals.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Trail Mix Method works so well for me because it removes the intimidation factor of a big project or a dreaded (but good-for-you) activity like working out by making them small time chunks. It is also balanced with different types of activities, which means you're actively preventing burnout. For example, not all of your trail mix activities are physical health-related or learning-related, as it&rsquo;s not about being hyper-productive in one area, which can lead to burn out. Third, it gives you a crutch to lean on in those moments of decision paralysis, when you have a lot of free time but have an &lsquo;AHHH I don&rsquo;t know what to do right now&rsquo; moment. It also allows you to use energy instead of just discipline to get things done - which means you can save that discipline for the things you have to do in your structured time. Finally, It removes the guilt factor that comes with not meeting a deadline you set for yourself.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><h5>WHAT IT'S NOT</h5></p>
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>It's not a system for urgent or time-sensitive tasks - since this method is all about flexibility in when you do things, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to use it for things that are urgently due, but rather things that may be have some flexiblity in when they can be completed. The reason for this is that urgent tasks add a priority system and hierarchy, and that undoes the &lsquo;equal value&rsquo; of every handful of trail mix. Normally, I go through my &lsquo;urgent tasks&rsquo; on my Todoist app, and then once my time has been freed, I can switch to my trail mix bag.</li>
            <li>It&rsquo;s not a place to sort  to-do&rsquo;s or things with external commitments that you &lsquo;have to get done&rsquo; (e.g., project deadline, doctor&rsquo;s appointment, picnic with friends) - because that&rsquo;s not part of your unstructured or free time. This is a way to think about activities you would do in free / unstructured time, after you&rsquo;ve completed your responsibilities for the day. It&rsquo;s things you WANT to do, not have to do; the things you believe will help you grow, increase your happiness, or break down your non-urgent &lsquo;have to&rsquo;s in a way that serves your energy. It&rsquo;s an energy and aspirations management system - that also happens to be a great method for productivity for your free time.&nbsp;</li>

            <p><h2>The Trail Mix Method</h2></p>

            <p><h5>HOW IT WORKS</h5></p>
            <p>As mentioned above, TMM is an energy management technique. Like trail mix, it has a mix of activities broken down into bite-size quantities, with balance between all the activities that make it up. These activities may be ideas you want to pursue, skills you want to explore, or even inner personas you want to feel into. Also like a trail mix bag, you put it together once, and then accept whatever comes out of it.&nbsp; Throughout the week when you have a free moment, you'll pull out something from the trail mix bag to use that time for.&nbsp;Each &lsquo;bite-size&rsquo; activity you draw will be the burst of energy you need to do the task.</p>
            <p>Once a week, you set aside 1 hour to build your trail mix bag (upfront structure) by filling it with goals, projects, personas, etc. that you want to work on or manifest in your unstructured time that week; then in your free moments, you reach into your &lsquo;bag&rsquo; and pick out the task you&rsquo;re going to do in that moment. Emphasis on unstructured time: this isn&rsquo;t a tool to manage deadlines or urgent tasks &mdash; that stuff belongs on your calendar or in your To-do app; this is about things you want to do for yourself that can happen today, tomorrow, or end of the week.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p><h5>CHARACTERISTICS</h5></p>
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Mixed and balanced bag: </strong>You get a little bit of everything, rather than a bag full of just one thing (e.g., you aren&rsquo;t making a bag of only M&amp;Ms, or only raisins - gross!)</li>
            <li><strong>Balanced bag:</strong> You also don't have too much of anything, because you think about how the activities relate to one another, as well as to your energy around that activity. (E.g., a balance of 'learning' related activities to 'health &amp; wellness', 'organizational', etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Bite size</strong>: Activities are not project based, but energy-based. They are little bursts of energy! (e.g., 30 minutes of a task rather than the entirety of the task)</li>
            <li><strong>Trust yourself and then let go:</strong> trust the bag you&rsquo;ve built (or the roots you've laid out) - having blind faith that whatever you need will show up. trust yourself and then surrender to yourself. Remember that you made the bag, and you were thinking about what you wanted to do - when you made it, you were coming from a place of empowerment, clarity, inspiration - so trust that past version of yourself!</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p><h2>Making Your Trail Mix Bag</strong></h2></p>

            <p><h5>THE WEEKLY RITUAL OF CREATING YOUR TRAIL MIX BAG</h5></p>
            <p>This is where the little bit of upfront structure and discipline comes in to help you surrender throughout the week. I schedule an hour chunk every Sunday night that I call &lsquo;Trail Mix Sunday&rsquo; where I create my bag for the week. Doesn&rsquo;t matter when you do this (morning, night, Sunday, Wednesday) but ideally whenever you feel your week starts so you can plan for the week. For your first Trail Mix Sunday, set aside an extra 30 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
            <br>
            
            <p><strong>Your first time: </strong></p>
            <p><ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> 5 minute meditation. Take a moment to settle your mind - it's okay to let it wander, but try to bring it back to your breath, observing the sensations in your body as you inhale and exhale. If you prefer a guided experience, click here for a guided meditation.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Set your intention for this Trail Mix bag: why are you doing this? What do you hope this tool will give you? What do you want more of in your life?</li>
              <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create category goals on a paper or in a notebook. Gather a notebook or a few sheets of paper, and a pen. Reflect on the following question: what are the areas in your life that you want to invest your energy? This is a reference that you will use every Sunday for your TM ritual. Some examples may be: Reading, Hobbies, Health &amp; Wellbeing, Creative Content, Learning and Development, Community, Income Generation, Personas, Organization -- and the list goes on. Pick about 5-8 categories that resonate with you to start, and keep them in an easy to access space - whether on your wall or at the front of your notebook, so you can refer to them each week.</li> 
              <img src="/img/content/trailmixcategories.png" style="width: auto;">
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Determine what your 'bag' looks like (see tips below). Once you've figure out the form, think of a structure that works for you: you could use fortune cookie sized paper, or you could use columns of bullets on a sheet.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <br>
            
            <p><strong>Your weekly ritual:</strong></p>
            <p><i>If it's your first week, skip to step 3; if it's your weekly ritual, start on step 1.</i></p>
            <p><ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>5 minute meditation. Take a moment to settle your mind - it's okay to let it wander, but try to bring it back to your breath, observing the sensations in your body as you inhale and exhale. If you prefer a guided experience, click here for a guided meditation.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Set your intention for this week: what do you want to feel, create, or channel? What do you want to give yourself?</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Reflect on last week's trail mix bag. What did you easily accomplish? What was harder to accomplish? What was left untouched in the bag? Circle any items that were particularly difficult, or 'leftovers' that you want to postpone for a future week. For the items that were difficult to accomplish or remained untouched, ask yourself: why was there resistance? Was the task too daunting? For the items you want to carry over into this week's bag, add them to your list.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go through your Category Goals sheet you created during your first Trail Mix Sunday, and for each category, reflect on your intentions for that category for the week. Then, add a few activities you want to direct your energy toward this week into your bag. Make them bite sized (see tips below) by adding a time allocation between 5 and 60 minutes, depending on how difficult or intimidating a task is (less time) or how easy or enjoyable it is (more time). This allocation makes a small difficult task equally attractive as a long easy task. If you want to do it multiple times that week, or if it's a task that will require more time to complete, add another bullet.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Take a step back and see whether your bag is mixed, balanced, and achievable this week (see tips below)</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6: </strong>Throughout the week, when you find yourself in a moment of unstructured time, reach into your 'bag' and complete the activity you draw. This may require a bit of discipline, but it's all about trusting that you've built the bag with only things you feel you can do. How much or how little you do is up to you as you discover your balance between productive time and plain old down-time :)</li>
            </ul></p>

            <h2>Q&A + Tips to create an effective Trail Mix System</h2><br>
            <p><strong>Q: What does the &lsquo;bag&rsquo; look like?</strong></p>
            <p>How you choose to form your bag is up to you, but the guiding principle is that you should use something physical (i.e., not on your computer). The reason for that is that lists on a computer don't have as much thoughtfulness and are too easy to manipulate after you&rsquo;ve set it.
              <ul>
              <li>You may choose to use a literal bag - zip lock or otherwise - with pieces of fortune-cookie-sized paper in it. Now THAT&rsquo;s true surrender!</li>
              <li>Or, it could be a half of a sheet of paper with bullets for the activities - I personally keep mine in a moleskin notebook (<a href="https://amzn.to/2sP2UMY">this one</a>). A list isn&rsquo;t as whimsical as a bag, but it helps me adjust which activity I &lsquo;pick out&rsquo; based on where my energetic state is (creative activities versus cerebral, physical, etc.).</li>
              <li>If you're feeling up for it, you could even design a generator or script that handles it for you, similar to daliakatan.com/do-now. If you do create a tool, please share it!</li></ul>
            </p><br>
            
            <p><strong>Q: How do I make activities 'bite-sized'?</strong></p>
            <p>As mentioned above, activities are not project-based (e.g., finish reading X, or write 1 blog post) but energy-based. When I was hiking, trail mix would give me about 15-30 minute bursts of energy, and I found that that was actually a great baseline to break down activities. It also helped make tasks more achievable, and by all means if I got into flow I could do it for longer! But that was MY choice to make, after I finished the bite-size activity. For example: 10 minutes - Read Julie&rsquo;s book. 60 minutes - code personal website. 30 minutes - yoga.
              <ul><li>Activities can last longer but YOU decide if they do - if you see yourself in flow, you can choose to take that extra m&amp;m or to extend your current task! (but also knowing that you should pull yourself out from going too deep to avoid burnout or imbalance, setting some maximum parameters). Flow is beautiful and hyperproductive, but it is not fleeting! You can get back into it at a later time.&nbsp;.&nbsp; if you get into &lsquo;flow state&rsquo; or a hyper productive mode and want to do more, you can; and if not, you&rsquo;ve come through on a small commitment, congratulate yourself and you move on to the next one.</li>
              <li>The goal is to have a bag where everything has equal priority or desirability - if some things are more desirable than others, you'll end up wanting to do only those things. So, to give all the activities equal weighting/value in the trail mix bag, I balance the enjoyment of an activity and the time it&rsquo;s allocated. For the things that I enjoyed less or that we&rsquo;re more daunting, I would lower the time allocated to it, so it became an easier investment (e.g., I hate reading, so 10 minutes felt like a safe commitment to reading Julie&rsquo;s book). For the things I enjoyed more, I allocated larger chunks of time, so that it was a more difficult investment and didn&rsquo;t become a default action. That way I never prioritize only the things that are easier or more enjoyable because I&rsquo;ve made the harder or less enjoyable things less daunting or more attainable.&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
            </p><br>

            <p><strong>Q: How do I determine when my bag's too full?</strong></p>
              <p><ul>
              <li>Add up the times, to get a sense of how achievable it is. You may not want to be &lsquo;doing stuff&rsquo; for your whole day, for example. If my list added up to more than 30 hours of tasks, I would know that&rsquo;s not achievable or desireable for me. I know that I spend X amount of my day doing structured tasks or dealing with the things that randomly pop up each day - this may include my nightly hangout with my boyfriend, my morning classes, time to cook dinner or travel between places, a coffee chat with a friend, etc. all of that takes away from the unstructured time I can predictably say I have in a week.&nbsp;</li>
              <li>Then, see whether it fits with how you want to spend your time (in categories too! like learning, writing, mental health, physical health, etc. - you don&rsquo;t have to actually place them into categories, but scan the list when you&rsquo;re done and see if you overindex or underindex in any area you want to work on).&nbsp;</li>
              <li>Finally, you should not feel guilty about not finishing the bag - you always make just a little more trail mix than you need, just in case. Not every minute needs to be productive! The goal is not to finish an entire bag in a week, but to have some structure to lean on.</li>
              </ul>
            </p><br>

            <p><strong>Q: How do I be true to 'flow' and minimize resistence?</strong></p>
            <p>Flow is a state of complete absorption in the task at hand - a feeling athletes get during their sport, artists get when painting, and perhaps you get when you do something you love or are really good at. It&rsquo;s being completely &ldquo;in the zone&rdquo;, losing track of time, enjoying the activity at hand, and sometimes even being so hyper-focused that you achieve an elevated level of productivity. You can create some structure to maximize your ability to get into flow (whether that means structure to get things you don&rsquo;t enjoy, or the &lsquo;behind the scenes&rsquo; of your life, out of the day so the remainder of time can be care-free, or structure to start and end your day like bookends to create a container for your flow state). Once you know you&rsquo;ve got some structure, or a container to play in, you can trust yourself and surrender into flow. This method aims to be true to flow, and there are a few things that may come up in that process: 
              <ul>
              <li><b>If you pick out a task and feelings of resistance come up, ask yourself why:</b></li>
              <ul>
              <li>Is the task too daunting? Trying lowering the time allocation - you can do ANYTHING for just 5 minutes.&nbsp;</li>
              <li>Is the task still too daunting? Maybe your energy just isn&rsquo;t there right now - be true to the energy that you&rsquo;re in. If you&rsquo;re in a creative mindset, maybe you&rsquo;re better off doing one of your learning or creating tasks; similarly if you&rsquo;re feeling very productive, you could pick one of your organizational or writing tasks. It is definitely okay to put the task back in the bag for a later time when the energy is there, and pick out another - just observe what tasks you&rsquo;re avoiding and ask yourself why.&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
              <li><b>If you find yourself done with the time you set for a task but still with energy to go on:</b></li>
              <ul>
              <li>You can add some more time, or add another chunk of that activity to your bag for later and move on to your next activity! There&rsquo;s a balance between going deep and burning out, so just be aware of your state and if you feel like you can go deeper, do so until before you feel like you&rsquo;re burning out. Exceeding one hour is usually when energy can begin to drain, but you can feel out your stopping point.</li>
              <li>For example, I was actually pretty hooked within the first five minutes of reading Julie&rsquo;s book - so I went on to read it for 30 minutes and felt great about it! On the flip side, I finished my 60-minute coding task, but still had a lot more to code. Remembering that the last time I coded for longer than an hour I had feelings of burnout (mentally drained for the rest of the day), I decided I would just add another 45 minute coding task to my list and come back to it at a later time.&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
              </ul>

            <p><strong>Tip: Graduating your Trail Mix Bag from Unstructured to Structured:</strong></p>
            <p>Sometimes, you'll find yourself so successful in accomplishing certain activities that you may want to move them into your scheduled routine. For example: I used to have an activity called &ldquo;20m - dance&rdquo; on my trail mix bag, and I enjoyed it so much that I decided to sign up for a salsa class every Friday afternoon. It&rsquo;s a commitment I've made, and its graduated from my trail mix bag to my calendar. That&rsquo;s part of the beauty of this method: helping build habits or eventual accountability!</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Other Methods I've Tried and How They Relate</h2>
            <p>In trying to manage my unstructured time, I&rsquo;ve tried many different methods: written to do&rsquo;s, Notes lists, project plans, Todoist, Trello, Asana, Slack, Bullet Journals, etc. but they were all place to store my tasks/projects, not a way to think through how the tasks related to my energy or to one another&hellip; or to manage my unstructured time. I also tried creating task tables with activities that I wanted to accomplish day by day, but I would just end up feeling bad at the end of the week when I didn&rsquo;t do the things I said I would, or when I kept carrying over activities from one day to the next coming to the next coming to the next.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
            <p>However, they worked great though for the structured time or commitments or urgent to-do's, and I use them as a complement to my Trail Mix Method! I think the important thing is to find two complementary systems that can keep you organized in both structured and unstructured time. For some super organized or hyper-motivated people, one system may work for both. But for me, the &lsquo;professional work&rsquo; version of myself with external commitments was very different from the &lsquo;personal work&rsquo; side of me that had to rely on internal accountability: it was HARD!</p>
            <p><strong>My structure: </strong>I use my trailmix bag is for things I want to do, and I use ToDoist and my calendar for things I have to do or that are time sensitive. Todoist has my urgent deadlines and &lsquo;don&rsquo;t forget to do X&rsquo;s. My trailmix bag is about the things that I believe will help me grow, increase my happiness, and break down things I have to do in a way that serves what i want to do. it&rsquo;s not a to-do list; it&rsquo;s not for urgent things - my to-do list complements it for thsoe things. It&rsquo;s a time and goal management system and productivity method.&nbsp;</p>
