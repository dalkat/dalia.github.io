            <p><i>This has been so hard to write, and so hard to not let the perfectionist in me take over! So a quick YAY that I've finally clicked send! My goal in writing these updates is to share my journey experimenting with a lifestyle that doesn't involve full-time or freelance work, to ask for help and input on the many questions I'm asking myself during this journey, and perhaps even to inject some inspiration on what's possible to the amazing people in my life. My one request is that I would LOVE to hear from you - if there's something that particularly resonates, or if you have advice from your own life journeys, write me a note, and let me know how you're doing, too :)</i></p>

            <p>In the words of <a href="https://amzn.to/2MeRJGh">Michelle Obama</a>, it's been four months since I "swerved" and left Deloitte, and yet it feels like an entire year has passed in that time. I've had a LOT of time to work with: time to focus on things I want to focus on - and when I want to focus on them; to explore different subjects and interests; and to show up fully for the people I care about (more on that below). I truly believe that this is what life is supposed to look like: having the freedom to play and be guided by our innate human curiosity.</p>

            <p>When I decided to leave the all-consuming consulting world to take this creative sabbatical, I soon realized that this time wasn't a&nbsp;<em>temporary</em>&nbsp;break from a job, and that this recovering type-A overachieving New Yorker had already made two big life decisions:&nbsp;</p>
            <ol><li>Full-time jobs are not for everyone, and I didn't want to return to one; and&nbsp;</li>
            <li>I would show people from all socioeconomic backgrounds that they, too, can design a wholesome, financially-sound lifestyle free from the 9-to-5.</li></ol>
            
            <p>I became consumed with answering the questions: &ldquo;What might life look like if it was designed around curiosity? What if we had the freedom to live our intentions as they arise, rather than giving the best hours of our days to a single entity?&rdquo; In essence, I realized that I wasn't trying to make a career change or figure out 'where next'; I was trying to make a life change, challenge what the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; path that's been set for many of us, and actively live my life.</p>
            <p>In good ol' consulting fashion, my sabbatical ironically fell into the rules of threes.&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The<strong> first part</strong>&nbsp;was where I'd reset, reflect, and reconnect with my intuition. I made space to reactivate and feed my senses, as well as to reflect and package up on the lessons I'd learned over the past few years so I could start my next chapter feeling like I had all the lessons I needed in my toolbox.&nbsp;(More on intuition at the end)</li>
            <li>The<strong> second part</strong>&nbsp;is where I'm at now, and it's all about play and the pure love of learning. We humans are so multifaceted and working 80% of our waking hours usually means we lose that multifaceted nature by prioritizing some interests over others. So I've created a playbox of unstructured time for myself and I'm honoring my love for play - whether picking up new skills or hobbies, building community events, or building micro-businesses for fun.</li>
            <li>The&nbsp;<strong>next part ahead</strong>, which I'm dipping my toe into now, is building out a financially sustainable alternative model for life that isn't just available to those with the privilege of taking a sabbatical, and isn't the typical all-consuming 9-5 nor the hustling freelance economy. More on that in my next update.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These four months alone have helped me reconnect with the human side of me: the creator, contributor, and chaser of curiosities. I very much intended to revive my curiosity and creativity over this sabbatical and I've been glowing with inspiration as both have reawakened in so many different facets of my life. I'm more alert and aware of both myself and the world around me, finding opportunities to show up in more meaningful ways for the people I love (myself included) and to create in the communities around me. </p>

            <p>(Un)surprisingly, one of the biggest revivers of creativity for me has been necessity - creativity truly does love constraint. With no income, I've found myself more crafty about ways to create instead of buy: everything from&nbsp;<a href="https://daliakatan.com/challah">baking my own challahs</a> to <a href="https://ezentialsf.com/">making essential oil candles</a>&nbsp;with some friends. This even includes walking an average of 4 miles every day because I no longer need to rush anywhere! Each necessity and observation has awakened a thirst for learning (<a href="https://skl.sh/2TE2fKn">online classes are amazing</a>), and sometimes even led to fun little side businesses like <a href="https://presently.fun">redesigning gifting-giving</a> for my 10-year old brother and his classmates. And when my savings burn would become too high, I'd find myself returning to freelance brand designing (reach out if you'd like a custom resume/portfolio site!) and grad school essay tutoring. That said, I've also had to use this time to unlearn a lot of habits, such as the need to always be productive, stimulated, or working toward something - aka 'busyness'. Boredom, after all, is time our mind sorely needs to settle, connect dots, and dream.</p>
            <p>Overall, it's definitely been up and down. There are moments where I feel inspired and unstoppable, and moments where I find myself tired and low energy - realizing what a toll this job took on my mind, body, and soul. There are moments I feel giddy as ever, and moments where I feel really down, so down that I'd end up returning home only two weeks in to my trip abroad (who knew you could be homesick after three years globetrotting for work and fun?!). But overall I feel tremendous clarity and happiness and feel like I&rsquo;m on the precipice of change. It&rsquo;s what you feel when you&rsquo;re so close to a tipping point or feel a major breakthrough is just around the corner. Maybe I'm cracking the perfect alternative lifestyle for anyone to copy and paste into their own lives.</p>
            <p>Below are some key themes of part one of my sabbatical, and some questions I&rsquo;d love to engage in with you. I've also include some suggestions off of my reading list.</p>
            <p>Best,</p>
            <p>Dalia</p>
            <p>P.S., I am so grateful for what the consulting world has taught me - it helped me channel and structure my creativity, it gave me an outlet to dedicate my energy and hard work ethic, and it presented me amazing people to learn from. Most likely, without it, I wouldn't have been able to come to the decision I've made with my sabbatical, and also wouldn't have had the tools to make it a reality.</p>
            <p>P.P.S: Our society puts a lot of pressure on people to always think about 'what's your next job' or 'have you started applying yet?' Let's challenge ourselves instead to ask those around us, 'Where is your heart leading you lately? what's your latest adventure? Or, what does your life look like right now?' Remember that "Life is a process, not an outcome" (<a href="https://amzn.to/2SU2qRd">Design Your Life</a>). I also want to pull in something from DYL on life being a process not an outcome and from Mindvalley on life design.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>From Karin:I really agree. I think we need to start by remembering we are human being and not human doing :)&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Key themes of part one of my sabbatical</strong></p>
            <p><strong>ON BALANCE</strong></p>
            <p>Burnout is so real. I left a job I loved not because I stopped loving the work or the people, but because I wasn't feeding the different energy sources that make me feel energized and fullfilled. Perhaps I failed at finding balance, but perhaps balance could not be found in a 50-60 hour workweek. I've been thinking a lot about balance, and how in my next chapter I may be able to still do work that I love - perhaps part-time - and balance that out with other things I also love, whether side hustles, passion projects, or just hobbies/learning time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>My questions for you:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Where have you been good about finding balance in your life? Where have you not?</li>
            <li>What boundaries have helped you protect your balance?</li>
            <li>How would you have described yourself 5 years ago? How about today? What's changed?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ON INTUITION</strong></p>
            <p>My last day of Deloitte was the day I flew out to Italy on my one-way ticket, but two weeks in to this fun and carefree trip to Italy I found myself helplessly homesick - even with my sister&rsquo;s company. Things in my relationship felt rocky, my friends and family were thousands of miles away, and I felt like I was trying to force myself to relax and enjoy. While a bad feeling, it reminded me of one of my goals in coming to Europe: get back in touch with my intuition. What this homesickness really came down to for me was a struggle between my head, my heart, and my gut, each of which was giving me a different message - to stay, to leave (Europe or my relationship?), to keep pushing through the hardship, etc. I couldn't figure out, which voice was my intuition, and which was my saboteur or inner critic? Was leaving weakness/failure, or was it strength?</p>
            <p>I think many of us have lost our ability to both hear and listen to our intuition - for a number of reasons, whether because we've been told so long what to do even if it conflicted with our gut (at work especially), or &hellip; With all the unstructured time that I have now, and so many projects and ideas fighting for my attention, reconnecting with my intuition has been such an important tool to navigating my decisions.</p>
            <p>I'd love to hear from you:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>What do you think has challenged your connection to your intuition? (Call it inner compass, inner voice, gut feeling, whatever!)</li>
            <li>How have you strengthened your ability to both hear and listen to your intuition?</li>
            <li>How do you separate your intuition from fear or the inner critic?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ON RITUAL</strong></p>
            <p>I think the last time I truly had a ritual or routine was in high school, when I knew every day what time I'd be at gymnastics, what time I'd be doing my math homework, and when my weekly Grey's Anatomy binge could consumer my attention. A decade later, the importance of ritual has been in my face a ton. not necessarily time bound, but having routine around certain things i find important. might be yoga on the beach one day, might be calling up a friend once a week, etc.</p>
