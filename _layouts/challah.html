            <b>Instructions</b><Br>
            <ol>
              <li>Combine yeast, sugar, and warm water in mixing bowl. Mix and allow to stand for 5-10 minutes (yeast should produce some bubbles in the water). </li> 
              <li>Beat the egg in a small cup, then mix in egg, oil, and salt with rest of mixture.</li> 
              <li>Gradually add the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition to avoid clumps of flower. As mixture thickens, begin kneading the dough. Continue adding flour as needed and knead dough for 5-10 minutes until dough is smooth and soft, and no longer too sticky.</li>
              <li>Optional: If adding chocolate chips or raisins, work into dough as you add the flour in the previous step.  
              <li>Shape the dough into a ball and leave in the mixing bowl. Cover bowl with slightly damp kitchen towel and let the dough rise for an hour (if you have time: let it rise for 1-2 hours, punch it down to remove air, then let it rise again for another hour).</li>
              <li>Once the dough has risen, split the dough into three equal parts (six if you're making two challahs) and roll into long logs on a lightly floured surface or cutting board. Then braid the challah.</li>
              <li>Line a baking tray with foil and lightly flour or oil the surface. Set the braided challah dough on the tray and set it aside for 30-60 minutes to continue rising (option to cover with towel). </li>
              <li>Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Brush the challah with egg yolk (could mix with a bit of water to loosen up the egg yolk). Optionally sprinkle with sesame/poppy seeds or sprinkles! Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
              <li>Enjoy!</li></ol>
