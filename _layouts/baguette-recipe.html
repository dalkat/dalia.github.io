For challah, the kneading activates the gluten which gives it it's fluffy, thready texture. </p>

            <b>Instructions</b><Br>
            <ol>
              <li>In a small bowl, add warm water, yeast, and sugar (mix briefly so all dry ingredients are wet). Set it aside for 5-10 minutes while the yeast activates (yeast should foam). </li> 
              <li>In a large mixing bowl, mix flour and salt, and create a well in the center of the mixture.</li> 
              <li>Once the yeast has foamed, pour it into the well and stir it into the mixture. Add cool water, a little at a time, while stirring. The dough should be shaggy and not too wet or dry to the touch. Avoid kneading the dough.</li>
              <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and allow it to rest for 30 minutes.
              <li>Move the slightly risen dough to a floured surface, gently press it into a rectange, and fold it into thirds. They turn around 90 degrees and fold it into thirds again.</li>
              <li>Oil a large mixing bowl and place the dough in it, covering it again with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel. Allow it to rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours (it should double in size)</li>
              <li>Divide the dough into four equal portions and shape each into a long log, folding in (lengthwise) from each side 2-3 times, and then flipped over seam-side down. Each log should be about about 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter, with pointed ends. </li>
              <li>Lightly flour a smooth kitchen towel and nestle each log about 2 inches apart. Cover with oiled plastic wrap and allow to rise for 30-45 mins. </li>
              <li>Preheat oven to 450 and place a pan with water on the bottom rack to begin steaming the oven (which is what gives baguettes their crispy exterior; make sure to refill the water if it's running low and be careful when opening the oven as the steam is hot!).</li>
              <li>Uncover the baguettes and transfer to a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet. Sprinkle them with flour and with a sharp razor, create diagnol slashes down each log. </li>
              <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes or until deep golden brown and let cool before enjoying!</li></ol>

              <i>PS: You can Æ’reeze them to enjoy another time! Once fully cooled, wrap extra loaves in foil and freeze; to reheat, just set oven to 450 again with a tray of water on the bottom rack, and bake for 5-7 minutes.</i>
