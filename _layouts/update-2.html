            <p><h5>Hi friends,</h5></p><br>
            <p>Life is just a roller coaster isn't it? Today is the one year anniversary of starting my creative sabbatical -- cue the confetti poppers! It's been one year of spending time (and financially supporting myself) outside of the traditional full-time job and of letting curiosity shape my life. It's been one year of absolutely no "normal" and no consistency in my life, and of treating life as "time on" rather than "time off". </p>

            <p>I definitely thought I'd share at more frequent intervals during this time haha, but I suppose sometimes zooming out and reflecting en mass can be a bit easier, and definitely insight-bearing. I wanted to share somethings I've learned and the ways they might help you in designing the life that feels best for you.</p>
            <br>

            <h5><b>10 'Aha' moments and what I learned:</b></h5>
            <p><ol>
            
            <li><b>Community is so important!</b> I'm lucky to have been surrounded by amazing humans who share similar values on life and purpose throughout this adventure. Until I moved to San Francisco three years ago, I hadn't realized that I'd been in communities out of convenience rather than out of full alignment for much of my adult life. Being forced to 'start over' in a new city meant I had to think critically about who I was at my core and then find community in which I could be my full self, maximize my growth, and more fully explore and share my gifts. Having a soul-aligned community of all backgrounds and ages was part of why I felt I <i>could</i> take this leap. It has helped me ground amidst change, get feedback, and have a constant flow of inspiration and learning. That community has extended far beyond my friends, too. There are dozens of 'professional' online communities I joined (like Womens Catalysts Community, Freelancing Females, and Solopreneurs). So, find your soul community. They say you're the average of the five people you spend the most time with: find the people that bring out the best versions of you!
</li><br>
			<li><b>Discomfort and boredom are incredible catalysts for creativity.</b> My little brother <a href="https://medium.com/@dkatan77/4-life-lessons-from-a-10-year-old-401503c7eb32" target="_blank">reminded me</a> of that last month. I think most of us would agree that we generally find ourselves too comfortable and too busy - a dangerous combination that hooks us in the status quo. In my uncomfortable boredom, I rediscovered that I really enjoy singing and signed up for free classes at CCSF (NYC has a free college program too!). I also rediscovered my love for creating and for bringing things into existence. Whether events, community gatherings, laser cut art, new companies, etc! 
</li><br>
            <li><b>Being intentional about your "time on" will help make it last. </b>I've met many amazing individuals in the past two years who took a similar leap of faith to redesign their lives. Their stories often ended with them returning to a full time role - sometimes, it was because they realized that's what they wanted all along; sometimes, it was because they got bored, stir crazy, panicked, didn't know what to do besides travel, or ran out of runway. Rather than scare me, it reinforced to me that I needed to have a "why" and a plan for this time. What helped me make it to month 13 of this 'creative sabbatical': <br>
            	<span style="margin-left:20px;">(A) <i>Call it what it is.</i> Make sure you're honest with yourself about what you need (is it a vacation or a break? A remote day each week? A job change? A complete life redesign?) and honor that </span><br>
            	<span style="margin-left:20px;">(B) <i>Build a timeline.</i> Different needs will call for different structures/timelines; in my first update, I wrote about how structured the three chapters of my sabbatical: reset, play, and build for financial sustainability. I gave myself time within each one, and different goals for each<br></span>
            	<span style="margin-left:20px;">(C) <i>Knowing A and B, be financially intentional with your time off.</i> A three-month break to travel between jobs will require a different budget than a 12-month sabbatical, the latter of which doesn't need to deplete all your savings. Which leads me to…</span>
</li><br>
            <li><b>The best way to make money is to not spend it. </b>Joe always says he wants to make sure that growth in his career and salary doesn't lead to a proportional increase in his cost of living. Sometimes that means taking inventory and deciding to cut back for a time. My first chapter was all about nourishing myself, so I knew it would be important to have a budget since I wouldn't be making money. I set generous guidelines around how many times of the week I could cook vs. eat out and what distances should be walked vs. of Ubered. I also did yoga at home with a free app, and found ways to exchange my time instead of money (e.g., volunteering at conferences and events I wanted to attend). Some friends chose to claim <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/how-to-claim-unemployment-benefits-2058799" target="_blank">unemployment benefits</a> during this time, which is great if you're eligible. By chapter 2, I knew that I'd want to stop digging into savings, so I'd have to start playing with different forms of income. That said, I wouldn't on a budget forever, as there were downsides to this, which I reflected on under 'What I would do differently' below. 
</li><br>
		
			<li><b>'Work' can meaningfully improve lives, but not necessarily the way it exists today.</b> Current 5-day workweeks are constructs of the industrial revolution and should not be taken as a given; isn't it crazy that humans historically worked <a href="https://bigthink.com/big-think-books/vicki-robin-joe-dominguez-your-money-or-your-life" target="_blank">far less</a> than what we do now? Things are changing yet again. I learned that some people just really love their jobs - and that option is and maybe will always be available to them! But <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/work-from-home-becoming-necessity-5057786" target="_blank">many more</a> need things to change. I don't think freelance is the answer, either, as some people really want consistency, want someone else doing the 'selling', or don't want to work for themselves. The workplace actually presents an awesome opportunity to learn new skills, celebrate teamwork, and work as a community toward something bigger. I don't think the future will be complete devoid of companies or offices, so the question becomes: how might we take the best of the workplace and use it to empower individuals to live more fully? I think part-time work is part of the answer. I've been interviewing different employers that have made that shift toward part-time and am compiling those interviews into a podcast and then book ('Part-Time Wild', message me if you want to chat about it or know potential sponsors and collaborators!)

				<br><br><center style="width:80%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"><i>Dalai Lama wisdom. When asked what surprised him most about humanity, he answered:<Br>
				<b>"Man! Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.”</b></i></center><br>
</li><br>

			<li><b>Managing unstructured time is SO different from managing structured time. </b>When there are no deadlines or clear deliverables and only your own interests and personal goals driving your time, the way that you create structure for yourself is totally different from what may have worked in an office environment; to-do lists and discipline can take away fun. I created a <a href="https://daliakatan.com/trailmix" target="_blank">tool</a> for myself that helped keep this 'life work; both fun AND constantly progressing forward, but there are many others :)
</li><br>

			<li><b>Develop a practical hard skill and you'll never go hungry.</b> Having a tangible and always-in-demand hard skill makes going independent a lot easier. For example, my uncle is a real estate broker, with 10 years as a barber under his belt, which he can always lean on if he needs work. When I was at Deloitte, one of my mentors called this having a "cash-cow": you'd have the work that you WANTED to do, and the work you knew you could easily get staffed on when the pickings were slim. In my case, it's designing and developing websites - a skill I picked up at age 13 that my parents always said would be useless (ha!). For others, it may be teaching yoga, writing/editing, photography, etc. This hard skill helped me find fun work during the 'in-between' periods when I was still figuring things out, or when consulting or startup stuff were lighter. Marketing these skills is a whole other conversation, in my case it's been word-of-mouth through my network.
</li><br>
			<li><b>Educate yourself (and your kids and your employees) on financial literacy ASAP.</b> It's so important to make sure women and minorities are properly financially educated! I found the whole 401K/HSA process so overwhelming when I was at Deloitte that for a year I wasn't receiving either of those benefits. That's money I left on the table. Fast forward a few years, there's now tons of tax and incorporation stuff I'm going through and while my 10th grade accounting notes are helping, there's still a lot to learn.
</li><br>

			<li><b>Take the learnings of your sabbatical as an opportunity to make change in your life.</b> A lot of people see sabbaticals as a break every few years to recover from burnout, before jumping right back into work and starting the cycle all over. If something about the status quo made you leave, remember toi ask yourself: did I just need a pause, or do I need to change up the status quo?
</li><br>
			<li><b>And finally, the big punchline a lot of you were asking about: passive income alleviates a lot of financial pressure -- but it does take time to build.</b> There are a lot of ways to become financially sufficient in this world (yes, all legal), and many of them can be done with minimal upkeep on the side. lot of people believe that: <br>
            	<span style="margin-left:20px;">(A) passive income is limited to real estate - and thus is capital intensive and inaccessible,</span>
            	 <br>
            	<span style="margin-left:20px;">(B) it's as effortless as <a href="https://amzn.to/2M1Ne39" target="_blank">Tim Ferriss</a> sets it out to be, and </span> <br>
            	<span style="margin-left:20px;">(C) what works for one person will work for them too.  </span><br>
    		<b>In reality,</b> there's a whole slew of options, it takes WORK to set up and to maintain, and the key is to find something that <a href="https://amzn.to/2ICaR0k" target="_blank">doesn't feel like work</a> to <u>you</u>. As I've been exploring, I've bucketed dozens of different passive income ideas into: sharing knowledge, sharing assets, providing access, providing tools, and outsourcing/automation. I'm still committed to writing more about the income sources I've played with, and identifying ways to make financial independence accessible across socioeconomic strata. It's too much to share in this update so it'll be in a separate one (if you're <a href="https://forms.gle/U6SYz1QxTACXAKgP8" target="_blank">this</a> list you'll get an email when it's live).


				<br><br><center style="width:80%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"><i>There's a great concept in <a href="https://amzn.to/2ICaR0k" target="_blank">Mark Manson's</a> Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck:<br>
				<b>Whatever you do in life will be a struggle, so you need to find the struggle that’s right for you.</b></i></center><br>

            <H5><b>Highlights and favorite moments</b></h5>

            <p><ul>
            
            <li><b>I got to explore a ton of new hands-on crafts and activities. </b>I picked up wood laser cutting, candlemaking, and bread-baking (challah, baguettes, bagels, pizza, you name it), among other things. I hosted a Pride rainbow challah bake and became an Airbnb Experiences <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/665697" target="_blank">host</a>! I also started volunteering at a community tea house in San Francisco called the Center SF, realizing how important being in a position of service is to me. I had the flexibility to take yoga classes in the middle of the day, remake my favorite (labor-intensive) Bukharian and Russian dishes from home, meet other incredible people with flexible work-lives at cafes across the city, and swim in the freezing Pacific on the one day it hit 95 degrees in San Francisco! (I'd have been so bummed to have been stuck in an office for that one!!)
</li><br>

			<li><b>I got to spend really meaningful quality time with my family,</b> including hosting my <a href="https://medium.com/@dkatan77/4-life-lessons-from-a-10-year-old-401503c7eb32" target="_blank">10-year-old brother</a> and then my sister, here in San Francisco! I've spoken with my aunt more in the last five months than in the last 10 years of my life, bonding over challah baking and our joint Airbnb Homes venture. Same for my uncle: I helped him revive his struggling 35-year-old furniture business! We thought: we have wifi, coffee, and comfy furniture... what if we repurposed the showroom into a co-working space, where you can buy the very couch you're sitting on? NY1 News came to our re-launch, airing the story in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/urbanfurniturenyc/videos/2304583662990468" target="_blank">English</a> and <a href="https://www.ny1noticias.com/nyc/noticias/nueva-york-por-la-manana/2019/05/29/muebleria-en-astoria-se-convierte-en-un-espacio-de-trabajo" target="_blank">Spanish</a>, and it also got covered by <a href="https://patch.com/new-york/jackson-heights-elmhurst/s/gqfcy/astoria-furniture-store-adds-co-working-space-stay-business" target="_blank">Patch</a>, <a href="http://weheartastoria.com/2019/08/where-to-work-astoria/" target="_blank">We <3 Astoria</a>, and featured by Croissant Co-Working!</li>
<br>
			<li><b>I published my <a href="https://medium.com/@dkatan77/diversity-to-inclusion-9-steps-to-unlock-competitive-edge-pt-1-c5954c113a49" target="_blank">first article</a> and was a guest on a <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/s1e4-how-to-create-more-inclusive-workplaces-dalia/id1472817382?i=1000444464236" target="_blank">podcast</a>!</b> Both small first steps toward my goal of making my past research at Princeton and Deloitte more accessible to the people who can actually make a difference in the workplace. Within the first 24 hours, the article got featured on Medium's homepage and then snatched up by Medium's largest active publication! That was cool.</li>
<br>
			<li><b>I met some really incredible humans.</b> You know that feeling when you meet someone and hours later you feel as though you've known eachother forever? I've been so lucky to have more than a few of those people walk into my life this past year.</li>
<br>
			<li><b>I got to adventure when I wanted.</b> I love being in the sun and by the water. I escaped the world on a short <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzpHXfCBuhE/" target="_blank">RV trip</a> for my birthday (where I experienced my first earthquake!); took an incredible two-month adventure with Joe across  Southwest US (including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxKevrCBxxy/" target="_blank">Antelope Canyon</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxKf_8TByaR/" target="_blank">Joshua Tree</a>), Oslo, Barcelona, and NYC; not to mention the unbelievable trek in Patagonia from my last post. But I also realized that I didn't have to go far to adventure, and very much enjoyed being grounded in one place! A lot of my adventures took place right here in San Francisco.</li>
<br>
			<li><b>I served my first customer for my <a href="https://presently.fun" target="_blank">startup</a>!</b> What started as a side project became a real thing, and it's been fun bootstrapping it and living up to my commitment to reduce waste. I'm currently looking for female/minority founder and small biz grants, if you know of any.</li>
<br>
			<li><b>I had a lot of fun freelancing, too.</b> I worked on eight freelance projects - 50% of which were the work I wanted to do (consulting startups) and 50% of which were my 'cash cow' (web design). Outside of freelancing, I also got to play around with other income sources, like becoming a GLG/Clarity expert and being a paid speaker on the topics of diversity and inclusion and innovation. It taught me a lot about how our time-value fluctuates at different times in our lives and how that doesn't discredit 'knowing your worth'. There were times I prioritized fun income sources (research interviews, Airbnb Experiences) and other times where I prioritized lucrative ones. I'll write about these, and the passive income ideas, more fully in another post (you'll get an email if you're on <a href="https://forms.gle/U6SYz1QxTACXAKgP8" target="_blank">this</a> list).</li>

            </ul></p><br>




            <h5><b>Lowlights and awkward moments</b></h5>
            <p><ul>
            
            <li><b>I didn't take good enough care of my mental and physical health, ironically. </b>I left full-time employment resolved to shed burn out and live my best life. I realize now that health is a really complicated equation. More than simply doing the things that make you happy, it's also about remembering to feed ALL of your energy needs, whether physical, emotional, psychological, spiritual, nutritional,... I wasn't aware of a number of things that were negatively impacting my mental health. For example, I wasn't sleeping well, which meant I'd sleep in, stay in bed, and before I knew it, days would blur and I'll have stayed home for a few days in a row. Guidelines would have helped keep my mental health strong, and to a point I raise a bit later, sometimes feeding all of your energy sources means prioritizing <u>spending</u> on yourself. 
</li><br>
            
            <li><b>Old habits die hard.</b> As another old adage goes: easy to get an A, hard to keep it. Change requires constant effort - this is true of work, relationships, growth, morning routines, etc. I'd gotten so comfortable a that I eventually fell into traps of default behavior, where I'd lose all the good habits I worked to build and pick old ones back up. That meant that eventually, even curiosity and motivation fled me! 
</li><br>
            <li><b>I do miss working with a team.</b> Let's face it, I'm an extrovert, and I love being around amazing people. I've been running a few consulting gigs and love having my clients as my teammates, but I'd end up putting a lot of pressure on my romantic partner to be that feedback source that a team usually provides. I don't think that means I want to jump back into a full-time job (and certainly nothing fully remote) but perhaps the part-time life is calling me.  
</li><br>
            <li><b>My biggest lowlight: My relationship fell apart.</b> Ever the optimist, I thought everything could be worked on if there was love. Sadly, it turns out love isn't enough. We still care about one another very much and I'm trying to figure out the whole 'get my heart back together, find a place to live, remain best friends / in one another's lives' situation. I'm mainly hurting though at the moment, as it was last week. But I'm so, so grateful to have other glowing hearts to lean on - y'all know who you are. 
</li>

            </ul></p><br>





            <h5><b>What would I do differently?</b></h5>
            <p><ol>
            
            <li><b>Read more fiction!!</b> There's no better creative escape. 
</li><br>
            <li><b> Accountability buddies.</b> I would have asked three friends and/or mentors to hold me accountable and check in with me once a quarter. It's easy to feel like you have to do it all / figure it all out yourself, so it's good to have people who care about you and your success reach out to *you* periodically to remind you of the goals or principles you wanted guiding your time on.
</li><br>
            <li><b>Guidelines & boundaries.</b> I had set a lot of guidelines around how I spend my money, and intentionally left open how to spend my time. And yet, to my point in my first update, some semblance of ritual is really important; put in other words, perhaps I *should have set some guidelines around how to spend my time after a while. I realize now how important it is to set boundaries, as self-led/self-employed life can also mean days blurring together, your bed becoming an office, and losing motivation or clarity around 'the goal'. This may be just values ('ask myself, 'does this make me happy?') or it may be guidelines around what to do / not to do to actively avoid pitfalls (e.g., don't work out of bed two days in a row, attend an event with strangers once every two weeks, etc.)
</li><br>
            <li><b>Spend on myself!</b> Yes, <strike>contradicting</strike> complementing my aha moment #4. Turns out, I'm actually very affected by money and have a lot of scarcity feelings around it. Saving is valuable, but an abundance mindset is equally so. When I started my sabbatical, my spending guidelines were really helpful and definitely crucial for chapter 1, but I realize now that we also need to give ourselves permission to spend on things that are important to our happiness and health, whether massages, therapy, a gym membership, etc. I found myself too "cheap" to want to pay for coffee and lunch every day to work from a cafe. I found myself too "cheap" to dress in ways that made me happy (although I blame SF, everyone's in jeans), which I used to enjoy. I found myself too "cheap" to take spontaneous weekend trips with my boyfriend. Even when my freelance work brought substantial income, I'd insist on keeping my 'chapter 1' spending budget rather than re-assessing. It wasn't until about a month ago that I realized I needed to rethink my guidelines around spending, and make sure I was channeling abundance to share joy around me. 
</li><br>
            <li><b>Keep therapy a consistent part of my routine.</b> I think I would have kept up therapy after my HSA (health savings account) ran out. It had helped me get over a lot of sadness and depression after I left Deloitte and around my relationship, and once those feelings had "passed" I decided I didn't need it anymore. I knew better, of course, but I couldn't justify spending the money. For anyone who needs affordable and remote therapy, <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/rpc/5cd9213d1b6dc6c901" target="_blank">Betterhelp</a> was great, with no-questions-asked 40%-off financial aid.
</li><br>
            <li><b>Gone off birth control sooner.</b> Let's talk about women's health! Yes, men, you especially! We all know birth control affects hormones, which also plays with your emotions. For some people, it removes PMS, but at the cost of numbing you over time, where highs and your lows both kind settle somewhere in the middle. I went off birth control about a week ago and what they say is true: within 2 days you feel like a completely different person! It's like one of those Claritin clear commercials where they pull away a film from the screen and suddenly everything's bright! I wish I'd done it sooner, but man there needs to be a revolution in the female health space. What innovative companies do you know who are working on this now?
            </li>

            <p>I'm not sure what to call the life I’m currently living; 'sabbatical' does give the impression of 'taking time for me', and perhaps after reading all this you'd agree that it's a great container for all these different activities. However, 'sabbatical' also gives the impression that it's temporary, and that I'm not working. I've been asked a lot about my time "off", and these conversations have made me realize that most people see work as our primary purpose in life, and living fully is a secondary priority when you're not working. </p>
            <p>These conversations have reaffirmed to me that I want the rest of my life to feel like a creative sabbatical, although what that means will certainly change over time, and perhaps the label for it will too (see 'What's been on my mind' below). What I know will be consistent is that I want to be human on my "on time", and treat work as the thing that I do when I want to take a break from living :) Or perhaps, eventually, integrate the two more meaningfully. </p>

            <p><b>Below are some key themes of part one of my sabbatical and some questions.</b></p>
            <p>I'd love to engage with you on any of the questions that resonate with you. I've also included some suggestions off of my reading list. Finally, if I can support your own creative journeys in any way, let me know how.</p>
<br>
            <p><h5>With love and thanks,<br>Dalia</h5></p><br>
            <p><b>P.S.</b> Pulling this back in from my last post as it's still relevant. Society puts a lot of pressure on people to always think about "What's next?" or, for those on sabbatical, "When is your vacation over?" (it's not a vacation) or "Have you started applying for jobs?" Let's challenge ourselves instead to ask those around us, "Where is your heart leading you lately?" "What's your latest adventure?" or, "What does your life look like right now?" To quote my favorite line in <a href="https://amzn.to/2Vfeka1" target="_blank">Design Your Life</a>: "Life is a process, not an outcome".</p><br>

            <p><h5>ON IDENTITY AND RENAISSANCE</h5></p>
            <p>Burnout is so real. I left a job I loved not because I stopped loving the work or the people, but because I wasn't feeding the different energy sources that make me feel energized and fulfilled. Perhaps I failed at finding balance, but perhaps balance could not be found in a traditional 50-60-hour workweek. I've been thinking a lot about balance, and how in my next chapter I may be able to still do work that I love &mdash; perhaps part-time &mdash; and balance that out with other things I also love, whether side hustles, passion projects, or just hobbies/learning time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>My questions for you:</p>
            <p><ul>
            <li>Where have you been good about finding balance in your life? Where have you not?</li>
            <li>What boundaries have helped you protect your balance?</li>
            <li>How would you have described yourself 5 years ago? How about today? What's changed?</li>
            </ul></p><BR>
            <p><h5>ON INTUITION</h5></p>
            <p>Intuition is the ability to understand something instinctively, going beyond conscious reasoning deep into your subconscious mind. Supposedly, it kicks into gear when you're under a time-crunch, in situations of information overload, or in danger. But I think more often than not, many of us have lost our ability to both hear our intuition and distinguish it from other internal voices &mdash; especially in a job where your opinion's worth is frequently weighted by your tenure.</p>
            <p>My last day of Deloitte was the day I flew out to Italy on a one-way ticket, but two weeks into my trip, I found myself helplessly homesick and even depressed &mdash; even with my sister&rsquo;s company. Things in my relationship felt rocky, my friends and family were thousands of miles away, and I felt like I was trying to force myself to relax and enjoy when I just wanted to stay in. While a bad feeling, it reminded me of one of my goals in coming to Europe: get back in touch with my intuition. What this homesickness really came down to for me was a struggle between my head, my heart, and my gut, each of which was giving me a different message: to stay, to leave (Europe or my relationship?), to ignore the pain and keep pushing on, etc. I couldn't figure out which voice was my intuition and which was my saboteur or inner critic. Was leaving weakness and failure, or was it strength?</p>
            <p>With all the unstructured time that I have now, and so many projects and ideas fighting for my attention, reconnecting with my intuition has been such an important tool in navigating my decisions.</p>
            <p>I'd love to hear from you:</p>
            <p><ul>
            <li>What do you think has challenged your connection to your intuition? (Call it inner compass, inner voice, gut feeling, etc.)</li>
            <li>How have you strengthened your ability to tune into your body and both identify and listen to your intuition?</li>
            <li>How do you separate your intuition from fear or the inner critic?</li>
            </ul></p><br>

            <p><h5>ON RITUAL</h5></p>
            <p>Have you heard of the <a href="https://amzn.to/2o6gWLy" target=_blank">Miracle Morning</a> or Morning Rituals? People swear by them and writers all over say it's vital to success. Unlike routine, which aims to bring order to the chaos of the day-to-day or to create a path toward excellence, ritual is a way to infuse some magic and energy into our lives. It's something we look forward to in the mundane, a gift we give ourselves. Both, as one <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/02/13/routine-ritual-anne-lamott-stitches/" target="_blank">blogger</a> writes, are necessary to live a full life.</p>
            <p>Being on the road all the time at Deloitte definitely made having a routine (or ritual) difficult &mdash; whether my Thursday morning yoga classes, unplugging and reading before bed, or even having a consistent sleep schedule. Now that I have so much unstructured time to play with, the importance of ritual is even further elevated.</p>

            <p>What about you?</p>
            <p><ul>
            <li>What rituals (not routines) do you have in your life?</li>
            <li>How do you follow through on them &mdash; is it discipline? Excitement? Habit?</li>
            <li>What brings you energy, and how can you incorporate that into your day?</li>
            </ul></p><br>
