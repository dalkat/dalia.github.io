            <p><h5>Hi friends,</h5></p><br>
            <p>Life is just a roller coaster isn't it? Today is the one year anniversary of starting my creative sabbatical -- cue the confetti poppers! It's been one year of spending time (and financially supporting myself) outside of the traditional full-time job and of letting curiosity shape my life. It's been one year of absolutely no "normal" and no consistency in my life, and of treating life as "time on" rather than "time off". </p>

            <p>I definitely thought I'd share at more frequent intervals during this time haha, but I suppose sometimes zooming out and reflecting en mass can be a bit easier, and definitely insight-bearing. I wanted to share somethings I've learned and the ways they might help you in designing the life that feels best for you.</p>
            <br>

            <h5><b>10 'Aha' moments and what I learned:</b></h5>
            <p><ol>
            
            <li><b>Community is so important!</b> I'm lucky to have been surrounded by amazing humans who share similar values on life and purpose. Until I moved to San Francisco three years ago, I hadn't realized that for much of my adult life, I'd been in communities out of convenience rather than out of full alignment. Being forced to 'start over' and rebuild community in a new city meant I had to think critically about who I was at my core - and then find community in which I could be my full self, maximize my growth, and more fully explore and share my gifts. Having a soul-aligned community of all backgrounds and ages was part of why I felt I <i>could</i> take this leap, and what has helped me throughout this past of change to ground, get feedback and ideas, and have a constant flow of conversations that brought inspiration and learning. That community has extended far beyond my friends, too. There are dozens of 'professional' online communities I joined (like Womens Catalysts Community, Freelancing Females, and Solopreneurs, where like-minded folks learn from one another. So, find your soul community. They say you're the average of the five people you spend the most time with: find the people that bring out the best versions of you!
</li><br>
			<li><b>Discomfort and boredom are incredible catalysts for creativity.</b> My little brother <a href="https://medium.com/@dkatan77/4-life-lessons-from-a-10-year-old-401503c7eb32" target="_blank">reminded me of that last month</a>. In general, I think most of us would agree that we find ourselves both too comfortable and too busy - a dangerous combination that keeps us hooked in the status quo. I rediscovered that I really enjoy singing, and I signed up for free classes at CCSF (NYC has a free college program too!). I was also reminded that I really love creating and bringing things into existence. Whether events, community gatherings, laser cut art (see carousel below!), new companies, etc! I love having the space to be constantly in a mindset of creating.
</li><br>
            <li><b>Being intentional about your "time on" will help make it last. </b>I've come across many amazing individuals in the past two years who took a similar leap of faith and set off to redesign their lives. Their stories often ended with them jumping back into a full time role, even if it didn't necessarily align with their life vision, because they got bored, stir crazy, panicked, didn't know what to do besides travel, or ran out of runway. Rather than scare me, it reinforced to me that I needed to have a "why" and a plan for this time. What helped me make it to month 13 of this 'creative sabbatical' is the following: <br>
            	<span style="margin-left:20px;">A) Call it what it is: make sure you're honest with yourself about what you need (is it a vacation or a break? A <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/work-from-home-becoming-necessity-5057786/" target="_blank">remote day</a> each week? A job change? A complete life redesign?) and honor that </span><br>
            	<span style="margin-left:20px;">B) Build a timeline: different needs will call for different structures/timelines; in my first update, I wrote about how structured the three chapters of my sabbatical: reset, play, and build for financial sustainability. I gave myself time within each one, and different goals for each<br></span>
            	<span style="margin-left:20px;">C)  Know A and B, be financially intentional with your time off. A three-month 'break' to travel will require a different budget than a 12-month sabbatical, the latter of which doesn't need to deplete all your savings. Which leads me to…</span>
</li><br>
            <li><b>The best way to make money is to not spend it. </b>Joe always says he wants to make sure that growth in his career and salary doesn't lead to a proportional increase in his cost of living. Sometimes that means taking inventory and cutting back. I had a budget for each chapter of my creative sabbatical, along with goals around revenue generation. My first chapter was all about nourishing myself, so I knew it would be important to have a budget since I wouldn't be making money. I set generous guidelines around how many times of the week I could eat out, what distances should be walked instead of Ubered, doing yoga at home rather than paying $20 for a class, etc. as well as finding ways to exchange my time instead of my money (e.g., volunteering at conferences and events I wanted to attend). (Note: there were downsides to this, I took it to an extreme. See lowlights below. Also, some friends chose to file for unemployment during this time; no shame in that, I should've.). By chapter 2, I knew that I'd want to stop digging into savings, so I'd have to start playing with different forms of income.
</li><br>
		
			<li><b>'Work' has a really meaningful opportunity to improve lives, but not necessarily the way it is now.</b> Current 5-day workweek constructs are relics of the industrial revolution; just as things changed then, they are in the middle of changing now and should not be taken as a given. I learned that some people just really love their jobs - and that option is and maybe will always be available to them! But <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/work-from-home-becoming-necessity-5057786" target="_blank">many need things to change</a>. I don't think freelance is the answer, either, as some people really want consistency, want someone else doing the 'selling', or don't want to work for themselves. The workplace is actually an awesome opportunity to learn new skills, work in a team, and work as a community toward something bigger - so I don't think the future will be complete devoid of companies or offices. The question becomes: how might we take the best of the workplace and use it to empower individuals to live more fully? I think part-time work is part of the answer. There is so much more to life than working, and if you look throughout history, humans have always worked <a href="https://bigthink.com/big-think-books/vicki-robin-joe-dominguez-your-money-or-your-life" target="_blank">far less</a> than what we do now. I've been interviewing different employers that have made that shift toward part-time and am compiling those interviews into a podcast and then book (Part-Time Wild)

				<br><br><center style="width:80%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"><i>There's a great quote by the Dalai Lama:<br> When asked what surprised him most about humanity, he answered "Man! Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.”</i></center><br>
</li><br>

			<li><b>Managing unstructured time is SO different from managing structured time. </b>When there are no deadlines or clear deliverables and only your own interests and personal goals driving your time, the way that you create structure for yourself is totally different from what may have worked in an office environment; to-do lists and discipline can take away fun. I found a tool** for myself that helped keep this 'life work; both fun AND constantly progressing forward, but there are many others :)
</li><br>

			<li><b>Develop a practical hard skill and you'll never go hungry.</b> Having a tangible and always-in-demand hard skill makes going independent a lot easier. For example, my uncle is a real estate broker, with 10 years as a barber under his belt - something he can always lean on if he needs work. When I was at Deloitte, one of my mentors called this having a cash-cow: you'd have the work that you WANTED to work in, and the work you knew you could easily get a project in when the pickings were slim so you'd always be 'staffed'. In my case, it's designing and developing websites - a skill I picked up at age 13, and one that my parents always said would be useless (ha!). For others, it may be teaching yoga, writing/editing, photography, etc. Having that hard skill helped me find work when I was still figuring things out, and bridge periods where consulting or startup stuff were lighter. My friend Annie asked, 'Okay but how do you <i>market</i> this skill?' In my case it's been word-of-mouth through my network and through some of the professional communities I mentioned above.
</li><br>
			<li><b>Educate yourself (and your kids and your employees) on financial literacy ASAP.</b> It's so important to make sure women and minorities are properly financially educated! I found the whole 401K/HSA process so terribly confusing when I was at Deloitte that I didn't receive either until a year into my time there. That's money I left on the table because I felt overwhelmed by the process and the options. There's also a TON of tax and incorporation stuff I'm now going through and while my 10th grade accounting notes are helping, there's still a lot I'm learning.
</li><br>

			<li><b>Take the learnings of your sabbatical as an opportunity to make change in your life.</b> A lot of people see sabbaticals as a break every few years to recover from burnout, before jumping right back into work the way it was before and starting the cycle all over. Just a small reminder I'd like to share, that if something about the status quo made you leave, you probably need to change the status quo, rather than just take a pause from it.  
</li><br>
			<li><b>And finally, the big punchline a lot of you were asking about: passive income alleviates a lot of financial pressure -- but it does take time to build.</b> There are a lot of ways to become financially sufficient in this world (yes, all legal). I lot of people believe that (1) passive income is limited to real estate - and thus is capital intensive, (2) that it's as easy as Tim Ferriss (**link) sets it out to be and doesn't require any work, (3) that what works for one person will work for all people. In reality, 1) there's a whole slew of options, which I've bucketed into sharing knowledge, sharing assets, providing access, prodiding tools, and outsourcing/automation 2) it takes WORK - whether to set up or to maintain, passive doesn't mean zero effort 3) what works for one person may not work for someone else, the key is to find something that doesn't feel like work (**subtle art...). I'm still committed to writing more about the dozen income sources I've played with, and identifying ways to make it acceessible. it's too much to share in this update so it'll be in a separate one (if you're on my listserv** you'll get an email when it's live) 

</li>

            </ol></p><br>



            <H5><b>Highlights and favorite moments</b></h5>
            <p><ul>
            
            <li><b>I got to explore a ton of new hands-on crafts and activities. </b>I got really into laser cutting fun designs out of wood, made candles for friends, became an Airbnb Experiences host teaching challah baking to people all over the world! I also got to spend my time in ways I wouldn't otherwise be able to. That includes volunteering at a community tea house in San Francisco called the Center SF (realizing how important being in a position of service is to me), taking yoga classes in the middle of the day, meeting other incredible people with flexible work-lives at cafes across the city, [family visiting] and heading to the beach on the one day it hit 90 degrees in San Francisco! (I'd be so bummed to have been stuck in an office for that one!!)
</li><br>

			<li><b>I got to spend really meaningful quality time with my family,</b> including hosting my 10-year-old brother for a week here in San Francisco! </li>
<br>
			<li><b>I met some incredible humans I felt extremely connected to.</b></li>
			<li><b>I served my first customer for my startup!</b> And currently looking for female founder / small biz grants… (name issues?)</li>
			<li><b>I got to adventure when I wanted.</b> I escaped the world on a short <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzpHXfCBuhE/" target="_blank">RV trip</a> up the coast for my birthday, spent an incredible month and a half long <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxKevrCBxxy/" target="_blank">adventure</a> with Joe across midwest, Europe, and NY, not to mention the unbelievable trek in Patagonia from my last post. I love being in the sun and by the water.</li>
			<li><b>I had a lot of fun freelancing, too.</b> I worked on eight freelance projects - 50% of which were the work I wanted to do (consulting startups) and 50% of which were web design and development, which was my 'cash cow' per above. Outside of freelancing, I also got to play around with other income sources, like becoming an Airbnb Experiences host on challah baking and leading classes for teams at different companies, becoming a GLG/Clarity expert, and being a paid speaker on the topics of diversity and inclusion and innovation. It taught me a lot about how our time-value fluctuates at different times in our lives and how that didn't discredit me 'knowing my worth'. There were I prioritized fun income sources (research interviews, Airbnb experiences) and other times where I prioritized lucrative ones.
</li>
			<li><b>I played around with numerous passive income ideas too, </b> which I'll write about more fully in another post as this one's full enough (you'll get an email if you're on this list).</li>
			<li><b>I discovered my Trail Mix Method.</b> I realized that it was productivity tool that worked really well for managing my time.</li>
			<li><b>I came back to my happiness in the last week.</b></li>

            <p><b>P.S.</b> Pulling this back in from my last post as it's still relevant. Society puts a lot of pressure on people to always think about "What's next?" or, for those on sabbatical, "When is your vacation over?" (it's not a vacation) or "Have you started applying for jobs?" Let's challenge ourselves instead to ask those around us, "Where is your heart leading you lately?" "What's your latest adventure?" or, "What does your life look like right now?" To quote my favorite line in <a href="https://amzn.to/2Vfeka1" target="_blank">Design Your Life</a>: "Life is a process, not an outcome".</p><br>

            <p><ul>
            <li><a href="" target="_blank">Subtle art of not giving a fuck by ...</a> &mdash; I like the bottom line: Whatever you do in life will be a struggle, so you need to find the struggle that’s right for you</li>

            </ul></p><br>

            <p><h5>ON IDENTITY AND RENAISSANCE</h5></p>
            <p>Burnout is so real. I left a job I loved not because I stopped loving the work or the people, but because I wasn't feeding the different energy sources that make me feel energized and fulfilled. Perhaps I failed at finding balance, but perhaps balance could not be found in a traditional 50-60-hour workweek. I've been thinking a lot about balance, and how in my next chapter I may be able to still do work that I love &mdash; perhaps part-time &mdash; and balance that out with other things I also love, whether side hustles, passion projects, or just hobbies/learning time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>My questions for you:</p>
            <p><ul>
            <li>Where have you been good about finding balance in your life? Where have you not?</li>
            <li>What boundaries have helped you protect your balance?</li>
            <li>How would you have described yourself 5 years ago? How about today? What's changed?</li>
            </ul></p><BR>
            <p><h5>ON INTUITION</h5></p>
            <p>Intuition is the ability to understand something instinctively, going beyond conscious reasoning deep into your subconscious mind. Supposedly, it kicks into gear when you're under a time-crunch, in situations of information overload, or in danger. But I think more often than not, many of us have lost our ability to both hear our intuition and distinguish it from other internal voices &mdash; especially in a job where your opinion's worth is frequently weighted by your tenure.</p>
            <p>My last day of Deloitte was the day I flew out to Italy on a one-way ticket, but two weeks into my trip, I found myself helplessly homesick and even depressed &mdash; even with my sister&rsquo;s company. Things in my relationship felt rocky, my friends and family were thousands of miles away, and I felt like I was trying to force myself to relax and enjoy when I just wanted to stay in. While a bad feeling, it reminded me of one of my goals in coming to Europe: get back in touch with my intuition. What this homesickness really came down to for me was a struggle between my head, my heart, and my gut, each of which was giving me a different message: to stay, to leave (Europe or my relationship?), to ignore the pain and keep pushing on, etc. I couldn't figure out which voice was my intuition and which was my saboteur or inner critic. Was leaving weakness and failure, or was it strength?</p>
            <p>With all the unstructured time that I have now, and so many projects and ideas fighting for my attention, reconnecting with my intuition has been such an important tool in navigating my decisions.</p>
            <p>I'd love to hear from you:</p>
            <p><ul>
            <li>What do you think has challenged your connection to your intuition? (Call it inner compass, inner voice, gut feeling, etc.)</li>
            <li>How have you strengthened your ability to tune into your body and both identify and listen to your intuition?</li>
            <li>How do you separate your intuition from fear or the inner critic?</li>
            </ul></p><br>

            <p><h5>ON RITUAL</h5></p>
            <p>Have you heard of the <a href="https://amzn.to/2o6gWLy" target=_blank">Miracle Morning</a> or Morning Rituals? People swear by them and writers all over say it's vital to success. Unlike routine, which aims to bring order to the chaos of the day-to-day or to create a path toward excellence, ritual is a way to infuse some magic and energy into our lives. It's something we look forward to in the mundane, a gift we give ourselves. Both, as one <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/02/13/routine-ritual-anne-lamott-stitches/" target="_blank">blogger</a> writes, are necessary to live a full life.</p>
            <p>Being on the road all the time at Deloitte definitely made having a routine (or ritual) difficult &mdash; whether my Thursday morning yoga classes, unplugging and reading before bed, or even having a consistent sleep schedule. Now that I have so much unstructured time to play with, the importance of ritual is even further elevated.</p>

            <p>What about you?</p>
            <p><ul>
            <li>What rituals (not routines) do you have in your life?</li>
            <li>How do you follow through on them &mdash; is it discipline? Excitement? Habit?</li>
            <li>What brings you energy, and how can you incorporate that into your day?</li>
            </ul></p><br>
